            <h2>Thursday 10th October</h2>
            <p>
                After my indulgent spending spree on Tuesday night (yes, that blog was an allegory about my reckless shopping),
                today brought the stark realisation that my dilemma lies in want, not need. While some purchases were 
                necessities,the more extravagant ones—the McLaren F1 hoodie, the Levi's jeans—were better returned. My frugal
                instincts, once again, saved me from myself. Yet, there’s nothing more déclassé than walking back into the
                stores where, just days earlier, I had proudly parted with a large chunk of my net worth, only to ask for 
                refunds. I could feel the judgement in the cashier's eyes.
                <br><br>
                One particularly irksome trend emerged: the disappearance of the physical card swipe in the refund process.
                At each store, they processed the refund remotely, without me even tapping my card. Unacceptable! I want
                visual confirmation! Either the reassuring beep or in a perfect world, dollar signs floating through the air!
                The clear signs that my money is being returned. Instead, I’m met with the assurances of the cashier who has 
                no obligation to spare me from their mendacity. “Your refund will be back in your account in three to five 
                days.” Will it? I suppose I have no choice but to trust you then. 
                <br><br>
                Putting this behind me, it was time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Leicester. Hello the bright lights of
                London. First on the agenda: SIX! The Musical. Immediately, time was against me as I rushed to the Vaudeville
                Theatre as the train was inevitably delayed. The musical was about the six ex-wives of Henry VIII and offered
                a refreshing format when compared to other musicals. Instead of telling a story, reliving their lives, it was
                similar to a concert with each character trying to persuade the audience that they were the most memorable wife.
                Complete with audience interaction and individual solos, I would recommend it to everyone. I thought the short
                runtime would hinder it but instead it enriches everything, giving it a brisk pace that keeps everyone engaged 
                and entertained from start to finish. Each performance is a burst of energy, drawing you in with catchy tunes 
                and clever lyrics. Similar to Hamilton, its purpose is to teach children about history whilst incorporating 
                modern references; joking about the patriarchy and commenting on the male hegemony of today. It is critically 
                well received for these reasons as well as passing the Bechdel test which most musicals tend to fail.*
                <br><br>
                After a brief photography session with my new zoom lens, capturing the London skyline between the Vaudeville
                Theatre and the Globe Theatre, I transitioned from reliving the embellished history of Henry VIII in the early
                sixteenth century to exploring the world of Shakespeare in the late sixteenth century. Liam was just as ebullient
                to be spending a night watching Shakespeare, which he showed by heading straight to the bar to indulge in red 
                wine before we took our seats. The Comedy of Errors, a classic tale of mistaken identity, intrigue, and the 
                complexities of love… the paragon of Shakespearean Literature. 
                <br><br>
                It’s about two sets of identical twins who are separated at birth and accidentally reunited through a series
                of fortunate circumstances. The ensuing chaos leads to comedic situations, wrongful accusations, and of course,
                a joyful reunion. This certainly wasn’t a tragedy. 
                <br><br>
                The Globe wasn’t sold out but still boasted a good turnout for a cold October evening. When I go again in the 
                future, I will be sure to put extra layers on. Tonight, Liam graciously supplied me with a woolly jumper as I
                was expecting the same warm temperatures I was enjoying in Leicester but ended up freezing instead. Two hours 
                of laughs, shenanigans and tomfoolery, the players took their final bow and it was time to go. Time to have a
                rough night’s sleep on Liam’s floor.
                <br><br>
                *The Bechdel Test is a simple measure of female representation in fiction, requiring that a work features at
                least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.

            <h2>Wednesday 9th October</h2>
            <p>
                Soar Point was buzzing as ever. The raucous thrills of students from all faculties, enjoying the camaraderie 
                of their respective societies. The Women's Champions League games, which garnered a larger crowd than I would
                have expected in a student bar, were displayed on every screen. Each table was lined with benches and discounted 
                menus to accommodate the extra influx of customers. Personally, I don’t know much about Women’s football. The 
                runners who I was with, shared a passing interest but their enthusiasm wavered once the conversation moved off 
                Lionesses Euro Campaign. While it was a successful night for Manchester City who won against Barcelona, Arsenal
                didn’t share the same glory, being huminited 5-2. When the fourth goal went in, that’s when the uproar started. 
                A group of supporters couldn’t contain their disappointment and as one would expect from a footballing crowd, 
                unleashed a diatribe of abuse at the screens. It was no different from what can be heard at a men’s game but
                because it was Women’s football and the pub was filled with students, many disapproved of the misogynistic 
                epithets. Still, I didn’t think it was anything egregious so continued my conversation with the runners. Five
                minutes later, the fans were being escorted out of the pub; followed by the owner’s statement, apologising for
                an offence which people might have suffered. I was in disbelief. I guess that’s the level we’re at here. I best
                not bring out my best Bernard Manning impressions or Jimmy Carr jokes. Soft tarts.

            <h2>Tuesday 8th October</h2>
            <p>
                Let me tell you a story. It’s about a man; tall, debonair, a true gentleman with a penchant for fine things.
                He carried himself with the grace of nobility, believing firmly that a man’s mood and fortune were shaped,
                in no small part, by how he presented himself to the world. His garments, he believed, were a reflection of 
                his spirit, and so he took great care to adorn himself in the finest cloth that gold could buy.
                <br><br>
                This man, though refined and prudent in most affairs, was not immune to the whims of vanity, and the allure
                of luxury tugged often at his heart. One evening, word reached him of a rare event—a grand market, closed
                to the commoners, where only those of youthful vigour and standing might enter. It was whispered that the
                best merchants of the realm would offer their goods at prices so low, they defied reason. A nobleman's
                wardrobe for a tradesman’s coin. 
                <br><br>
                To make the market more tempting for these young souls, the guilds set forth amusements to capture their
                fancies. There was music, lively as a royal ball, played by minstrels who stood high on a dais in the midst
                of the square. Brightly coloured pennants flapped in the evening air, strewn across the market stalls like 
                the banners of a noble tournament. It was like a merry festival, yet strange, for no guiding hand of elder
                or master was there to rein in the wild spirit of youth. For but two hours, these apprentices had free reign
                to barter, trade, and snatch up the finest wares at unheard-of discounts, as if time itself had been turned 
                to favour them.
                <br><br>
                Into this revelry strode our protagonist; a man no different from his peers, eyes wide at the splendour and 
                goods displayed before him. He had no thought of thrift or restraint, for such a night comes but seldom, and 
                never again might such bargains be offered. So, as though possessed by a strange frenzy, he dashed from one 
                stall to the next, his purse jingling with the coin he had saved.
                <br><br>
                He purchased fine woollen breeches, velvet doublets fit for a nobleman, a grand leather jerkin, and even a 
                hooded cloak emblazoned with the crest of a famous knightly order. Each piece he bought with little thought,
                for the prices, they said, were far lower than any would find on a common market day. And so, laden with goods,
                he strode back to his quarters, a triumphant smile upon his face.
                <br><br>
                Yet, as the moon rose higher in the sky, and the frenzy of the fair faded, the young man sat amidst his newly 
                acquired riches and began to reckon his coin. He gazed in his reflection; in awe at his sartorial elegance for
                it was then that a troubling thought took root. He had spent far more than he had ever intended. What use had 
                he for so many fine garments? Could he truly afford to keep all that he had purchased? And indeed, did he even 
                need such luxuries, when simpler wares might serve him just as well?
                <br><br>
                And thus, my friends, this tale stands as a caution to all. For even the sharpest mind can be dulled by the 
                glitter of a fleeting bargain, and in the rush to seize every treasure, one may return home burdened with far
                more than they need—or can pay for. Better to be the one who walks the fair with a discerning eye and a steady 
                hand, rather than the one who staggers away with empty pockets and full regrets. After all, it’s not the
                abundance of fine things that brings satisfaction, but the wisdom to leave behind what you never truly needed.
                <br><br>
                Hopefully, you can deduce the allegory behind that story. I’m sure the more perceptive folk will pick up on the 
                deeper meaning. Or perhaps, much like the man in the story, you’ve been swept up in my fine words and now find
                yourself sitting there wondering, "Wait… what was the point again?" But fear not—unlike the man, at least you 
                didn’t spend anything and it was only time you wasted!

            <h2>Monday 7th October</h2>
            <p>
                Waking up at five in the morning does not do anything to improve my productivity for the day. If anything, 
                it stymies motivation. I struggle to sleep because of a number of factors. One: my mind is too active with
                developing mobile apps. I’m thinking of all the opportunities which become available once I complete this
                module. Two: my duvet is two thick for these warm autumn evenings. Opening my window is not an option to 
                counteract this because the incessant sirens are insufferable. Three: my mattress is springy - and not in
                a good way. Four: There are too many things happening at the moment for me to get an early night anyway. 
                <br><br>
                So what do I do if I can’t comfortably get back to sleep? Well, I start reading, which is futile because
                I haven’t had enough REM sleep which means the part of the brain which consolidates memory is not working
                efficiently. Thus when I awake a few hours later, I will have forgotten the pages I’ve covered. Option two 
                is to persist in trying to sleep which is rarely successful. Lastly, I will start coding. This normally
                means I’ve given up on sleep and am ready to start the day… at five in the morning. Call it productive or
                an auspicious start to the day. It takes its toll on me when it comes to the evening activities when I am
                struggling to keep my eyes open. I have sacrificed running with the group tonight and cancelled my place
                in Pilates - all because I am sleep deprived. I need to do something to fix this.

            <h2>Sunday 6th October</h2>
            <p>
                Bollocks. I’ve made the Futsal team. After my poor performance during the trials on Friday night, I thought 
                it would be a long shot to assume that I’ll be selected. Obviously, the coach had a few laudatory voices 
                chirping in his ear convincing him that I’m worth the gamble. As previously mentioned, I have a busy schedule 
                with all the other activities and societies I want to be involved in. Ideally, futsal would just be a social 
                event where I could pick and choose the sessions which I wanted to attend. This news certainly has complicated 
                a few things. There is no rush to decide as I don’t need to pay the sign-up fee for a few weeks, therefore my
                plan is to stick to my timetable prioritising Hackers and Demon Media and see how many free evenings I can
                spare after those commitments. Futsal doesn’t embellish my CV which is why it’s third in my pecking order. 
                Irrespective of my dilemma, I am honoured to be selected; knowing that my skill is being recognised.

                What brings together, transgender people, ex-drug addicts, insomniacs, non-binaries, and schizophrenia
                patients. That’s right. The Media society. The home to the society outcasts basking in solitude.
                Everyone as uniquely protuberant as the next. These people have taken the time out of their day, exited
                their caves, to grace us with their presence to join the new intake of Demon Media. “Write what you
                know,” was the advice the current editor-in-chief told us. Hardly a niche magazine then but if the
                possibilities are endless with little moderation or censorship, this magazine is going to be a mix
                between Orwell’s ‘nineteen eighty-four’ and Freud’s ‘The Psychopathology of Everyday Life’. Out of the
                three strands of Media, I am focusing on Radio and the Magazine. Enough to learn new skills but not
                dominate all of my time.
                <br><br>
                For the record, that’s Futsal, Running, Karting, Hackers, Demon Media, Racing and Pilates all happening
                alongside my studies. There are also cultural exchange classes which look appealing which run from
                November to March which serve as a good additional qualification to complete after my Erasmus year. With
                all of these extra curriculars, it will be impossible to keep up to date with everything so some will
                have to be demoted to occasional outings. Competitive futsal is looking less and less likely since I
                have access to free sessions when I have time anyway at the Watershed. The trial this evening went
                poorly too so I’ll see if I even make the team. At the end, I was still asked what my number was so
                there may be hope yet. I think I’m being picked from reputation alone. After gaining the nickname ‘Cold
                Palmer’ by the players already on the team, it’s evident I showed some skill in previous sessions to
                gain such a reputable moniker.
                <br><br>
                Irrespective of the outcome this evening, Monday evenings are also reserved for Pilates. It’s four days
                on and I can still feel my abs flaring up when I sit up in the morning. Karting will likely take a back
                seat too; partly because it’s expensive to participate and very time consuming. I can still take part in
                the society socials at Soar point to watch the F1 races on the weekend which I’m fervently waiting for.
                <br><br>
                PS. The camera lens which I bought off ebay on Wednesday evening arrived five days earlier than
                expected. First inspections have revealed no conspicuous faults but we’ll see when I go for my first
                photography session this weekend. Everything seems to be falling into place auspiciously.

            <h2>Thursday, 3rd October</h2>
            <p>
                Bit of a disconcerting atmosphere in the building today. Similar to a heavy pall lingering over a city.
                It started off as a normal day; all was well. That was until a resident overdosed in the common room. I
                don’t know the symptoms of an overdose or what one looks like outside of the flicks, but from the
                detailed descriptions I got from my friends on the ground floor, it sounds similar to a seizure. I’m not
                sure who was with her at the time or what was taken, but by this evening, the Rashomon effect had truly
                taken hold, and I was hearing all forms of speculation. Was she suicidal? Was it a cry for help? Was she
                spiked? Was it an accident? From the tales I’ve heard today, it’s similar to a creative writing
                assignment I did in Stockholm where we were given the end of a short story and we needed to write the
                beginning. Each story is different, with complex characters and embellished storylines. The only
                definitive fact I know is that someone overdosed. Current status unknown. End of.
                <br><br>
                Onto a lighter topic. On my perpetual quest for social interaction this year, I had another society
                gathering this evening: DMU Hackers. The one I’ve been most anticipating. Relevant to Comp. Science by
                association, though not directly included in my course modules. Dilan was genuinely pleased to see me
                when I stepped out of the elevator. I think a friendly face was all he needed since he was running the
                society this year. Given his extensive knowledge in Cyber Security, he is more than qualified. In
                addition to the culmination of his placement year at IBM, he could pass for a lecturer now. I won’t bore
                you with the ins and outs of the meeting, but it was great fun, and I regret not participating in
                previous years. If only I were more confident…
                <br><br>
                We concluded the meeting with a visit to Soar Point, the campus sports bar, which I am starting to
                become a frequent visitor through the different societies. Mehmet, Natalia’s boyfriend, was there with a
                few of his engineering friends who he introduced me to. Some I already had the pleasure of speaking with
                at the DMU Racing brief. These are the lads who will hopefully be teaching me how to build an engine. I
                just need to manage my time effectively so I have enough bandwidth to take part in all these
                extracurriculars. My current thought process is omitting Futsal from my schedule and only doing a
                session a week instead of the competitive league for which I have been scouted. The trial is tomorrow
                evening, so I’ll update you on how that plans out. Though the first Demon Media society meeting starts
                at six, so I’ll have to think of a crafty excuse to account for my premature exit. See what I mean about
                my busy schedule…

            <p>
                I’m a thief. Well, actually, a fraudster would be a more accurate description. Remember those Asics
                running trainers which were half a size too big? Well, after a five-minute cleanup job and a steady hand
                attaching the tags again, I have managed to fool the Sports Direct staff into thinking they were unworn.
                That’s right—a pair of running trainers which I ran 5k in while it rained, plus an active Pilates
                session straight afterward, and I’ve exchanged them for a pair which is half a size smaller. I almost
                feel guilty, but my acuity towards subterfuge is to be admired.
                <br><br>
                Onto my academic endeavors for the day. After the unchallenging lecture and practical session yesterday,
                and consultation with Dillan, I have persuaded my course leader to allow me to switch to Mobile App
                Development. Therefore, I am not repeating the same module which I completed in second year. Also, this
                means I get to have classes with Dilan, which is always a huge benefit. Why not just stick to Big Data
                and Machine Learning since you’ve already got the finished coursework, I hear you ask? Well, even though
                I achieved a first in the module last time out, I actually want to learn a new programming language and
                get a modicum of experience in the mobile development industry. To be honest, I despised operating the
                infrastructure which DMU employed to handle Big Data databases, so I didn’t want to put myself through
                that again. Also, the Kotlin programming language is so intuitive; I practically already know it from
                learning its derivatives.
                <br><br>
                After a long-anticipated wait, Jimmy Carr has finally come to Leicester. We managed to snag tickets for
                the half-nine showing—me, Natalia, and Natalia’s boyfriend, Mehmet, who happens to be a really nice guy.
                The show was as expected, with insults, heckles, and banter. Very funny. The audience participation is a
                must because I felt like snappy one-liners get tiresome after a while. The spontaneity of the audience
                is what makes it unique. Though there were a lot of jokes which I have seen him perform before on
                YouTube, etc. When the audience shouts a heckle relating to his tax affairs, he has the same
                choreographed routine to defend himself. Also, rehearsed clapbacks when asked about Trump, Biden,
                Starmer, Epstein... I heard him do one joke which I first heard him perform on an episode of <em>Eight
                    Out
                    of Ten Cats</em> in 2019. Nevertheless, it was a great evening, and I would recommend everyone go to
                watch
                him at least once.

            <h2>Tuesday, 1st October</h2>
            <p>
                The society group chats have been in full swing today. The Racing Society has been talking about F1 for
                six hours now—and I love it. There are around seventy members, each with a fervent opinion about the
                status quo in the driver championship. I occasionally throw in an obviously contentious point of view
                just to rattle a few people. I know—I’m a prick. I am also part of the Running group chat, which is home
                dominantly to last night’s joggers complaining about their aches and pains. I’m in the same boat as
                them, but I’m stoic and don’t publicly announce my weaknesses.
                <br><br>
                A dark horse society which I’ve joined is the Doctor Who Society. There are only a handful of us in the
                group chat, so I don’t know what level of participation I am going to achieve. Call me old-fashioned,
                but 40% of the members identify as ‘they,’ and they have already given me negative first
                impressions—either from their kowtowing to other group members to hammer home their pronouns or their
                Calvinistic approach to running a society. A personal pet peeve of mine, and I know it’s nitpicky:
                people who don’t use proper grammar or spelling when texting. I don’t mind abbreviations, but
                individuals who say ‘I fought’ instead of ‘I thought’ are clearly Satanists. That is a speech
                impediment; therefore, they have no excuse to extend that poor vocabulary into the medium of text.
                <br><br>
                Moving away from societies, I had my first timetabled lecture and practical today. Having made my notes
                yesterday, this introductory session was nothing strenuous. The first Big Data and Machine Learning
                lecture was no hardship. The most discerning thing I learned is that out of a class of approximately one
                hundred students, 71% had never used the Python programming language. These are Computer Science
                students! As I have already done two Big Data modules (one at DMU in second year and one in Stockholm),
                I should be an expert at machine learning algorithms. I must not get complacent; I must not get
                complacent; I must not get complacent.
                <br><br>
                The biggest hardship I faced this morning, technologically speaking, is trying to get my Linux laptop
                connected to the DMU WiFi. After thirty minutes debugging myself and a further thirty-five minutes with
                a crestfallen IT officer in the library, I finally connected. I am the first student he has helped who
                has faced this problem in thirteen years. Speaking on the phone to the IT staff in Gateway House, he was
                elucidating the need for updated documentation so these problems don’t reoccur. Also, in that
                conversation, I was referred to as ‘a gentleman of discernment and taste’ when it comes to operating
                systems.
                <br><br>
                Now I’m off to the DSU to participate in the pièce de résistance of my fresher's journey—the event which
                I have been preparing for since March: the pool tournament.

            <h2>Monday, 30th September</h2>
            <p>
                The DMU Global trips have been released. During my time here at university, I have made the most of
                these trips—first going to Bilbao and then spending a year in Stockholm. This year is my final year, so
                I obviously don’t want anything to clash; however, it looks like the majority of trips are happening
                during the first week of Easter, which is convenient. There are a few that have caught my eye: Berlin,
                Salzburg, Dublin. Unfortunately, they are not available to my faculty. There are several trips in the
                extracurricular category which are applicable to me: employment workshops in Paris and culture in
                Alicante. I would be happy with attending either. I have been to Spain a lot in the past few years, but
                I cannot turn down the opportunity to practice my Spanish. Alternatively, I have been looking at going
                to Paris for a while, and this would give me ample opportunity to see all the sights. All trips are five
                days long, but the bursary applied to each varies. The opportunities I am eying up will cost me around
                £200, which is very good since accommodation and flights are included.
                <br><br>
                Since the academic year started today, the remaining freshers' activities are taking place almost every
                evening this week. I am not a drinker nor a clubber, so I don’t have much planned this week. The pool
                tournament I have been practicing for is taking place tomorrow night, marking the end of my freshers.
                Most of the societies have their first meetings or activities this week, so my evenings are almost all
                booked up anyway.
                <br><br>
                This evening, for instance, I was running with the group. We were doing laps around a track. Lauren is
                the pace setter, as she can run a mile in around 6.30 minutes. In total, we covered an accumulated 5k,
                which is a nice round number. Upon finally running in my new trainers, I have come to the conclusion
                that they are actually half a size too big for me. If I am duplicitous enough, I will clean them up and
                try to return them. Though that might be too devious even for a man with my flexible moral compass.
                <br><br>
                After running, I had Pilates booked at the Watershed. I hadn’t eaten anything in five hours, my muscles
                ached, my groin was tight, and my thigh was on the verge of being pulled. I was satisfied with the
                exercise I had done for the day and was ready to shower and crawl into bed, but Kyra, one of the
                runners, persuaded me to attend since she didn’t want to go alone. Having completed a couple of yoga
                sessions, I was expecting much of the same. In truth, there were a lot of similar moves; however,
                Pilates focused more on core exercises. Instead of completing them until you hit your rep target, the
                purpose is to control each movement and take your time, many of which activated my abs more than any
                workout session in the past. Despite my trepidation, it felt like it soothed my aches and pains; though
                now, I have the added addition of stinging abs along with painful legs when I wake tomorrow.

            <h2>Sunday, 29th September</h2>
            <p>
                Treachery! I have just found out that ‘Fear Her’ has been removed from BBC iPlayer because that episode
                contains scenes with the disgraced Hugh Edwards. Doctor Who is well-known for including real newsreaders
                or presenters to increase the verisimilitude and Britishness of the show. While this contributes to its
                charm, it also means the show is subject to the ever-shifting landscape of BBC politics, which the
                corporation must carefully navigate. Since Edwards' declasse status, the Beeb has rightly cut ties with
                him, but that means that any programs he has appeared in need to be removed from the public domain.
                Alas, even episodes where he only features for a meagre few seconds. You would think the higher-ups at
                the Beeb would tactfully dub the scenes or even recut the episodes given the popularity of the show, but
                no. Hitherto, season two of Doctor Who is missing a much-loved episode…
                <br><br>
                Moving onto a less contentious part of my day, after last night’s festivities, I am walking around
                zombie-like today. Anything less than the required eight hours of sleep gives me headaches.
                Nevertheless, I trekked to Abbey Park to partake in the final fresher event and to round off a very
                successful week of acclimatizing to life back in Leicester. ‘Park Life’, as it is advertised, was
                supposed to be a carnival-type affair with games, activities, crafts, and sports—mediums to help the new
                intake mix and socialise. Arriving at midday, an hour into these events, I was greeted with a rather
                lacklustre show of DSU ambassadors and a scarcely filled park. Only a small group of students decided to
                show up, meaning the overall success of the event was wavering. It’s one of those things which takes
                mass participation for the event to be successful. Despite the event being ‘sold out’ on the DSU
                website, the actual turnout was met with general apathy, so I made a premature exit and had my first
                relaxing day to myself, where I could watch the football and catch up on my reading.
                <br><br>
                In other news, Natalia has booked the tickets to see Jimmy Carr after consulting Mehmet. I have been
                watching this venue for a while, so it’s good to finally have it booked. Alas, now I just need to try
                and fit it into my busy schedule.

            <h2>Saturday, 28th September</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first day which I have no DMU activities or sports on. Thankfully, instead of rattling
                around my room for the day, I do have a few errands to run. After doing the weekly shop at the big
                Tesco, I also picked up a few extra things for Octavia’s party tonight. It’s the first time meeting up
                with Emily and Natalia since before leaving for Stockholm so I am euphorically looking forward to it. Of
                course, Saturday’s are reserved for football and with Nana’s VirginGo installed on my iPad, this makes
                it significantly easier rather than finding a dodgy stream that doesn’t buffer. Pleased with
                Middlesbrough’s two nil win over Stoke, I watched another film which had been on my watch list since its
                release: Miller’s Girl.
                <br><br>
                It was a low-budget flick, written by a writer with credits in the MCU and DC world but this was her
                first stand-alone film which she also directed. Ignoring the low ratings on IMDB, I thought it was
                enjoyable. Nothing too spectacular, but as a writer, I appreciate the quality vocabulary used in the
                film. Facilely, the story follows the life of a student (Jenna Ortega) who takes inspiration from her
                English Professor's book and uses it in her college thesis. The issue is that the Professor’s book
                contains an erotic scene and the student focuses entirely on that scene - writing fictitiously what
                could happen between the student and the professor. It shares simililaries with <em>Lolita</em> but 
                modernised it. In that the student is 14 so wouldn't fly in today's delicate world but you can see 
                where the writer got their inspiration from. Depsite the poor reviews, I actually enjoyed it though 
                it may be because of the varied lexicon instead of the mundane vernacular which appeals to the mass
                market. Martin Freeman and Jenna Ortega are personal favourites of mine too.
                <br><br>
                Moving onto the festivities this evening. I wasn’t told that it was Octavia’s birthday on Monday till
                very late into the evening. Honestly, when they were bringing out the cake, it should have been a
                giveaway but still I was ignorant of the fact. Natalia has continued working for the lecturer as a
                research assistant which she was with for the majority of her final year. She did think about doing a
                PhD but ultimately opted against it. Technically, she is taking a gap year to get more experience doing
                research as that is what she hopes to be doing in the future. As it is a paltry wage; she is still
                working at Starbucks on the weekend but as a manager now. Emily and Octavia work in the same care
                facility, helping children with learning difficulties through the medium of drama. Very noble indeed but
                it does suit their empathetic need to help people.
                <br><br>
                Natalia’s boyfriend was there: Mehmet, who coincidentally, I had already met at the futsal session
                yesterday. Small world huh. He is doing engineering and is part of the Racing Society which I’ve signed
                up to. I guess I’ll be seeing a lot of him. Good thing, he’s such a laid back type of person. Emily and
                Taves’ brothers also turned up; Mikey and Tobey who are good fun to be around. Mikey is 23 and works in
                a zoo. Toby is slightly more reserved but he is only 18 and starting UOL next week. I was the oldest in
                the room; a fact which I didn’t think bothered me but as I’ve had pointed out to me this week, this is
                starting to be a common occurrence. We played a lot of board games and a few party type games like
                charades. All good fun of course. Living in the building attached to Highcross is very convenient
                because it is a short walk through the shopping mall to get to their flat, however at two o’clock in the
                morning, I needed to add another fifteen minutes onto the journey, walking the circumference of the
                buildings.
                <br><br>
                Exhausted, I was in bed and asleep by three o’clock. My springy bed isn’t as big an issue as I initially
                thought. Accordingly, when you’re tired enough, you’ll sleep anywhere. After the busy week I’ve had,
                it’s not surprising that I haven’t had time to complain!

            <p>
                After a busy four days meeting and greeting new people, today can be classed as a quasi day off. There
                is a ‘fun day’ at the DSU but based on the description of the event online, it sounds uninteresting and
                just a ploy in order to put another event on the schedule in order to make the purchase of the freshers
                wristbands seem good value. For the sole purpose of getting me out of the flat, I played football
                instead. As it was mid-afternoon, it was a much quieter session but the skill level was distinctly
                higher. This could be considered a training session for the DMU Futsal team because there were so many
                already distinguished players in the game. Nevertheless, I held my own. Scored a couple, assisted a few
                more. Try-outs will be interesting.
                <br><br>
                Came home to find my room had been broken into. Just kidding. The plumber had let himself in to fix the
                leaky toilet. The push button had too much pressure on it so he replaced the full body. He shares
                similar views to me about Leicester. As he’s an Aussie, he only travels into Leicester for work but
                couldn’t live here. If it wasn’t for his wife, he would be moving back to Australia. He’s the first
                person I’ve met too who speaks complimentary about the British weather. After he was done, I had the
                rest of the day to myself. ‘Miss Sloane’ has been on my watchlist forever so I finally had the time to
                sit down and enjoy it. No football is on tonight so I just relaxed feeling ebullient about my successful
                freshers week.

            <h2>Thursday, 26th September</h2>
            <p>
                Since the same societies were occupying the DSU building, I was going to miss the final day of freshers
                since I have already signed up for half a dozen societies and clubs. However, the gentle persuasion of
                Hannah changed my mind. I met up with her and her friend Zed and checked out the DSU. Due to the
                declining interest, a number of societies decided the third day wasn’t worth it so the tables were only
                occupying two floors, not three. Since almost everyone I’ve met this week is doing English Literature or
                some other form of Humanities, I have plenty in common with them. Zed is a facsimile of me from first
                year. Very taciturn and when she does speak, it’s laconic and meticulous. If she could have it her way,
                she would be getting dragged around freshers by Hannah. Anyway, afterwards we had a brief lunch from one
                of the stalls. It was very insipid food which is to be expected from makeshift food stalls. I bade
                farewell as I wanted to play football this afternoon and needed to get back to change.
                <br><br>
                All the sessions at the Watershed are still part of the ‘taster experience’ therefore are free and no
                need to book. This is perhaps a hindrance rather than a benefit when thirty people show up to play in a
                meagre sized hall. The lads present were the same few who persuaded me to join the trials so they were
                easy to talk to. Because of the vast interest, more than half the allotted time my team sat on the
                bench. Nevermind. Some of the current futsal team were there and they were scouting new talent.
                <br><br>
                After a quick shower and a brisk walk back to the Watershed, I partook in my second yoga session of the
                week. In the normal timetable, Yoga will clash with the DMU Hackers meetings on Thursday nights so I’m
                the epitome of ‘here for a good time, not a long time’ type thing. There was much more interest in this
                session which is understandable now everyone is finding their feet around campus. Francesca messaged me
                as the class was finishing saying she was running late. Poor time-management is clearly one of her
                faults as she missed the entirety of the session. This could be perceived as divine intervention because
                I was caught in a thunderstorm on the way home. After camping out in the Watershed for ten minutes, it
                showed no signs of passing. Bravely wrapping up, I ran back to St Martins House but I was rightly soaked
                through. I do hope I don’t get a cold.

            <h2>Wednesday, 25th September</h2>
            <p>
                Before attending day two of the freshers fair, I picked up more essentials from town. Instead of doing
                one big shop, I’ve been doing it in stages. I also had another purpose for visiting town today: running
                trainers. I had been scouting the shops up north, but they were too dear, as Nana would say. Here, I
                have dedicated running shops and other independent retailers, which brought me an extended selection.
                The problem was, the prices skyrocketed in these retailers. Alas, I went to Sports Direct, even though I
                don’t like to support Mike Ashley. I managed to snag a pair of Asics for £64, which I think is
                reasonable. As long as I don’t go mad shopping in the next few weeks, I’ll be able to amortize the cost
                from the largesse of the parents.
                <br><br>
                The freshers fair was not as popular today compared to yesterday. The DSU was just as busy with
                societies, but the interest from the students had subsided. As promised, Dilan was there at the DMU
                Hackers table. We had a brief but interesting catch-up. He’s still at IBM until the end of the week, so
                it’s almost guaranteed that he’ll have a job after graduating. The Hackers meetings happen weekly,
                normally in Gateway House. Currently, that isn’t a problem, but during the second semester, I might have
                a seminar overlapping. Problem for later.
                <br><br>
                The most fortunate meeting of the day was seeing the stall for DMU Runners. This is a society that
                simply goes running together. Since I’ve just bought new Asics this morning, I thought it was prudent to
                have a chat with them. Coincidentally, they are meeting at the pub this evening to get to know the new
                intakes. More on this to come. Being circumspect, I said I’d think about it. That was because I had a
                previous engagement for this evening: yoga.
                <br><br>
                That’s right. I’m turning into a spiritual middle-aged man. I’ll be reading tea leaves and telling
                fortunes with a crystal ball if I’m not careful. Held at the Watershed, the session had only four others
                present. Strangely, all women; who’d have thought. The movements were slow and controlled. “It’s all
                about breathing out the bad energy and inhaling the good energy.” The session was an hour long, and we
                were doing all the classic poses: downward dog, the chair, deep lunge, the rag doll. Oh yeah, I’ve
                learnt a lot. We even meditated at the end; however, I admit I did find it difficult not to laugh during
                the silence at this new-age bollocks. “Focus on your breathing. Breathe in hopes and dreams. Breathe out
                negativity and impure thoughts.” What? Is this a front for a religious society now too?
                <br><br>
                I met Hannah and Francesca at this class. They’re starting their first year, both studying English
                Literature. Obviously, we had a lot of similar interests and have read almost identical books. Plenty of
                Dickens and Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.G. Wells, even Shakespeare. Who knows, there may even be hope
                yet of reciting Shakespeare monologues to each other.
                <br><br>
                After a quick shower and a bite to eat, I headed back into town to meet the runners at Soar Point. This
                is the go-to place for society socials because of the generous deals offered to students and also the
                large TV screens showing football. The Karting society has an arrangement with the staff to watch the F1
                there on Sundays too, as long as it doesn’t clash with the football. No doubt, I’ll be a regular if all
                goes well.
                <br><br>
                The Running Society is good fun. There is a good mix of people, boys and girls. Very affable. We played
                cards and Uno, spoke about our subjects, and shared our hobbies other than running. I was at the head of
                the table with the committee members: Katie and Lauren, who were the undersecretaries. Tobias, who had
                graduated last year, is a very funny man and also a paramedic, so he’s a handy friend to have. I was in
                the Soar till around eleven before we headed out to Firebug, another pub whose USP was offering a retro
                gaming experience whilst people drink. Mario Karts, Black Ops zombies, MW3. I felt a wave of nostalgia
                just seeing the consoles. It was just myself and the committee members who ventured to Firebug, as the
                rest took the long voyage to Black Cats, which was part of the Freshers experience. As a non-drinker, I
                haven’t invested the £40 in a wristband to get me access to these clubs, but I was content to stay with
                the runners. I heard the Running Society is well-run. Well run—see what I did there? They have a group
                running almost every night of the week, so we can pick and choose our days and distances. They also do
                social runs where they dress up, which will be … eventful.

            <h2>Tuesday, 24th September</h2>
            <p>
                Mark the date. My first attempt at being sociable. The DSU building was packed from the ground floor to
                the top with societies and sports teams, all trying to persuade you to join. No wonder I opted to avoid
                this in past years. This would have been an introvert's worst nightmare, having everyone asking
                questions and engaging in conversation. Now, however, I welcomed the challenge. After queuing for the
                best part of an hour to even get in, it was actually enjoyable because I had previously looked online at
                potential simpatico societies. The stalls I was actively looking for included: DMU Hackers (a computer
                science society), Karters (a go-karting club that holds socials where they watch F1 together), and Demon
                Media (the De Montfort magazine and radio proprietors). I thought this triumvirate would be a good place
                to start.
                <br><br>
                Having scoured from top to bottom, I found the latter two but no sign of DMU Hackers. Serendipitously, I
                ran into Dilan on my way home, who happens to be on the committee. The reason for their absence was due
                to a lack of space in the building, but they would be there tomorrow.
                <br><br>
                The Karters were a passionate bunch, and they all shared simpatico views on F1 as I did. This looks
                promising. I am less enthusiastic about Demon Media because the quality of the magazine looks mediocre.
                In conjunction with the poor design and large blank spaces permeating each page, the writing was subpar.
                I probably sound like Liam when I say that I could do a much more comprehensive job if I were to take
                over. Similarly to the futsal, I’m not looking for a heavy workload, just a medium in which I can
                publish a few articles now and again. The first meetings are happening next week, so I will definitely
                give them a go at least. On my way out, the Futsal society cornered me, and they didn’t let me bypass
                them without signing up for the trials happening in the next few weeks. It’s nice to be wanted.
                <br><br>
                Back at St Martins House, a FIFA tournament was meant to be held, but the staff couldn’t work the TV, so
                that has been postponed till next week. Nevertheless, I held residence in the common room with a few
                others, enjoying the conviviality. There were Nigerians, Londoners, Brummies, and me—purposely confusing
                them all with my northern vernacular. “I canny see the point in gandering about for no reason like” was
                a personal favourite malapropism of mine. The look of bewilderment on their faces was amusing in itself.
                Anyway, I have gained a few more followers on Insta, so we can keep in touch. Overall, they seem like
                good people.

            <h2>Monday, 23rd September</h2>
            <p>
                The first week of moving into new accommodation is always the most expensive. Stocking up on the
                essentials plus the weekly shop too, normally brings me to around £50 for the week. I was exhausted for
                some reason yesterday so I’ve been putting off the shopping and living on bread and the frozen foods
                which the local Tesco Express stocks. I was carrying out the menial tasks today such as updating my
                student card and re-registering for the forthcoming year so I was active anyway. The Diamond Jubilee
                Leisure centre is on the way to the big Tesco’s so I enquired about the free classes available to me.
                Unbeknownst to me, it was completely the wrong place, leaving the receptionist perplexed about my
                questions. Turns out, it’s actually the Watershed where the DMU Active session takes place - a DMU owned
                complex which has dedicated staff which also houses many of the sports societies too.
                <br><br>
                Following my productive conversation with the staff, I received a sheet with all the taster sessions on
                which would be happening throughout freshers. As futsal is the most popular, they are holding four
                sessions this week so everyone has a chance. No need to sign up or register. Just turn up and play.
                Simple. The futsal session was eventful. I wanted something relaxed, (if there is such a thing in
                football), to keep me active throughout the year. Evidently there must have been a few members of the
                DMU futsal squad there scouting because I’ve been ushered to go to the try-outs. I didn’t particularly
                think my performance was as good as it normally is but the enthusiasm which the players had when
                speaking about my skill was too ingratiating for me to say no. I guess I’ll be playing competitive
                futsal this year…
                <br><br>
                My third flatmate moved in today too - Esther. She’s studying microbiology at UOL so I’m not sure how
                much I’ll see of her. She seems congenial like Summer but I still don’t know how close we are all going
                to be.

            <h2>Saturday, 21st September</h2>
            <p>
                Today, the first day of my journey through my final year at university. After bidding adieu to the
                parents from my new apartment building, I was able to explore. Being located almost centrally to
                everywhere I go is ideal but the longer journey to the Tesco Superstore may become irksome after a
                while. But for now, I am satisfied with my room; the bed is springy but it’s one of those things I’ll
                have to live with. Also from having brief chats with the staff at the reception, this location is
                normally quiet due to the reduced number of rooms compared to their sister buildings. My only roommate
                at the moment seems cordial which is all I can ask for at this point. I just hope this ‘university
                experience’ which I so craved does not come to bite me on the arse because down the road when I have a
                full apartment.
