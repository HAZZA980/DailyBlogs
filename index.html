                <h2>Monday, 2nd June</h2>
                <p>
                    So, here I am, my final week of university. The end of a chapter that, at times, felt like it would
                    never arrive. There’s just one exam left on Friday, though I already know I’ve passed it based on my
                    results in other modules. And yet, I can’t summon any motivation to prepare. If I’m honest, I’m not
                    just unmotivated - I’m low. Maybe even depressed.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s hard not to look back and feel like I’ve squandered time. So much of my life has been swallowed
                    up by hesitation, by anxiety, by an inability to simply move. I started university not out of
                    ambition, but because I was stuck - in a slump I didn’t know how to climb out of. I thought a degree
                    might help. And in many ways, it has. I’ve grown, achieved, learned. But the cost has been high.
                    <br><br>
                    For the first two years, I lived in a self-contained studio at CODE - quiet, modern, and isolated. I
                    spent almost every hour there. I skipped Freshers entirely, too afraid to show up. Too unsure of
                    myself to belong. I didn’t meet anyone outside my course. And even within that small circle, the
                    social experience was limited. Computer Science can sometimes feel like an inverted boys’ club -
                    closed off, competitive, and emotionally distant. No wonder I withdrew.
                    <br><br>
                    My goal was simple: get a First. And I did just that. I completed every assignment, hit every
                    deadline, performed to a high standard. But I did it in solitude. No nights out, no shared houses,
                    no memories that weren’t anchored to a screen or a submission portal. I achieved the goal - but I
                    bypassed the experience.
                    <br><br>
                    I wasn’t ready to move to London, but I was ready to leave Darlington. Ready to start living. Only…
                    I didn’t. I moved cities, but not lives. I may as well have done an online course, for all the
                    difference being in Leicester made in those first two years.
                    <br><br>
                    Now for a slight digression that explains a chain of events that changed everything.
                    <br><br>
                    It was the summer before I started university, 2021. I went to visit Matthew in Manchester. The trip
                    didn’t exactly go to plan: shortly after I arrived, he informed me that his flatmate had just tested
                    positive for Covid. Cue my anxiety going into overdrive. That, in turn, triggered my bizarre eating
                    habits, and I ended up starving myself for the entire day. But that’s not the important bit.
                    <br><br>
                    For reasons I still can’t fully explain, that same morning I decided to start learning Spanish. I
                    downloaded Duolingo, figured why not, and began what would become the beginning of a much bigger
                    journey. That interest carried on into university. I even signed up for Spanish lessons on Tuesday
                    evenings during my first and second semesters. Granted, they weren’t exactly rigorous - they were
                    gamified to keep things light and fun - but they did give me access to a native Spanish speaker,
                    which was invaluable for pronunciation and grammar. It kept me engaged.
                    <br><br>
                    After those lessons, I applied for the DMUGlobal trip to Bilbao. The idea was to test out the small
                    amount of Spanish I’d managed to pick up and to see how far I could push myself outside my usual
                    comfort zones. The trip was framed as an Erasmus taster - a glimpse into what it might be like to
                    study abroad. The real aim, of course, was to sell the idea of doing a year overseas. At the time, I
                    wasn’t seriously considering it. I was still clinging to the naïve notion that graduating at 24 was
                    already pushing it, and delaying that even further wouldn’t do me any favours. I just wanted to
                    practise my Spanish. But it was in the post-trip debrief, when second year rolled around in October,
                    that something shifted. I started thinking: maybe studying abroad wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
                    <br><br>
                    My first choice was the College of Charleston in South Carolina. I had it all planned out -
                    researching flights, looking at accommodation, daydreaming about American life. But, as it turns
                    out, the partnership between DMU and CoC had broken down due to a lack of reciprocity. In short: no
                    Americans were keen on coming to Leicester - and honestly, who could blame them? The worst part? No
                    one told me this until after I submitted my application. So, while I was busy fantasising about
                    Charleston, I didn’t give my second choice much thought. I picked it quickly, assuming it didn’t
                    matter. That turned out to be... less than ideal.
                    <br><br>
                    And just like that, I was off to Stockholm.
                    <br><br>
                    I won’t dive into a full review of my time in Stockholm - mainly because I’ve already documented it
                    pretty thoroughly across these blogs over the past year. But in short, compared to friends like
                    Daria and Trust who did get to go to the US, I can’t help but feel like I missed out. Being snowed
                    in during -20°C blizzards wasn’t exactly the glorious, picturesque Stockholm I had in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, despite my fairly negative view of that year abroad, I came out of it with one thing I didn’t
                    have before: confidence. Travelling independently through a dozen or so countries gave me a kind of
                    quiet boldness - a willingness to explore, to strike up conversations with strangers, to walk into
                    new spaces alone and unafraid. When I returned from that summer of travelling, I couldn’t wait to
                    get back to DMU. This time I’d be living in the city centre, in a flat with other students.
                    Confident, open, finally ready to give the "university experience" one last proper go. Join
                    societies. Say yes more. Actually go out.
                    <br><br>
                    And to be fair, I did. Sort of.
                    <br><br>
                    I went to Freshers Week. Tried Pilates. Joined the Media and Hackers societies. Even signed up to
                    the newly formed Doctor Who society - for no reason other than curiosity and chaos. I did a few runs
                    with the Running Society, went karting with the Karting Society, and even learned the fundamentals
                    of a combustion engine with DMU Racers. I figured out how to produce a radio show - had a presenter
                    and everything - until she tragically took her own life just before Christmas.
                    <br><br>
                    I also wrote for Demon magazine - multiple pieces, actually - and now I’ve been nominated for a
                    Demon Writers Award. It’s only within the society, so it’s completely arbitrary, but still. And of
                    course, the one constant this year has been football. I’ve played twice, sometimes three times a
                    week. Looking back, though, I probably should have skipped a few of those matches with strangers in
                    favour of deeper connections - sitting around a pub table, talking nonsense and making memories.
                    <br><br>
                    On paper, this all reads like some sort of personal renaissance. And yet, it still feels incomplete
                    - like I haven’t ticked off everything on the elusive university bucket list. That realisation only
                    hit me in Paris. I started the year thinking I didn’t care much for clubbing or dancing. I was ready
                    to socialise, yes, but still under the illusion that because I don’t drink, clubbing just wasn’t for
                    me.
                    <br><br>
                    That changed a little in December. The DMU Racers' Christmas party in Stamford was actually a great
                    night - more of a pub crawl and quiz than a proper night out, but fun regardless. The Hackers'
                    Christmas meal, however, was a disaster. That night, I had my first (and only) panic attack - right
                    there at the dinner table.
                    <br><br>
                    In Paris, I was with people who made me feel confident - people who made me want to try new things.
                    And I was fully locked into the mindset of <em>“I’m in Paris, so I’m going to make the most of
                    it.”</em> So I broke my own rules. I went clubbing at Pachamama. And honestly, that changed
                    everything.
                    <br><br>
                    I wasn’t the shy 18-year-old hiding in the corner anymore. I wasn’t worrying about how I looked or
                    how I danced or if anyone was watching. I was just... present. Everyone was focused on themselves,
                    so I finally gave myself permission to do the same. For the first time, I wasn’t paranoid or
                    watching the clock. I was exhilarated. I didn’t want the night to end. I even tried to convince Amy
                    and Mae to find another club - to keep dancing until dawn. It was a lovely idea in theory, but in
                    reality Mae fell asleep the moment we sat down at the bus stop.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I came back from Paris with something more valuable than a good memory: friends. People I
                    actually wanted to keep in touch with. The kind of people you grab a spontaneous lunch with or text
                    last minute to go bowling or shopping. People you make time for - not out of obligation, but because
                    you want to. And that’s wonderful. But it’s also come far too late.
                    <br><br>
                    The night out with the Running Society summed this up perfectly. I should’ve been running with them
                    every week, showing up to socials, making those connections earlier. Last Saturday we didn’t even go
                    clubbing - just drifted from pub to pub. And if you asked the others, they’d probably describe it as
                    a fairly average night. But for me, it was electric. Just being out, talking, laughing, enjoying
                    life with people who had similar interests, similar energy. People who were funny, interesting,
                    extraordinary.
                    <br><br>
                    But I was just another face that night. A temporary addition. A guest, not a friend. I’d chosen
                    football over running, and looking back, I realise I might’ve had a better social life had I
                    committed to the runners - or at least alternated between the two. Yet another opportunity missed.
                    <br><br>
                    When I leave university, the only people I’ll truly be leaving with are the ones from Paris. And
                    even then, we’re all heading in different directions. Amy’s off to Mercedes in Bicester. Mae’s
                    staying with the DMU careers team over the summer, then moving back to London. Abbey’s only in her
                    first year, so she’ll be here for a while yet.
                    <br><br>
                    And me? I want to move to London. I know that’s where I want to be. But, if I’m being honest, I feel
                    like I’m slipping into another rut - different from the one I was in when I started university, but
                    a rut all the same.
                    <br><br>
                    While I’ve changed in almost every way over the past four years, I can’t help but wonder what my
                    university experience would’ve been like if I’d started with the mindset I have now. If I’d arrived
                    more open, more self-assured, more ready to chase the experience instead of sitting back and
                    expecting it to find me. Instead, I’m left with this lingering sense of unfulfillment. I’m
                    frustrated - not just because I missed out on what are supposedly the <em>best years of your
                    life</em> - but because I finally understand what I needed to do… just as it’s all coming to an end.
                    <br><br>
                    At least I’m ending on a high? That shouldn’t be a question - and yet, I’m not so sure.
                    <br><br>
                    At 18, I was completely stuck in my own head. Paralysed by anxiety. Constantly second-guessing
                    myself. Sam Turners helped break that cycle by encouraging me to apply to university in the first
                    place. And I tried - I went through CBT therapy, I learnt to identify the triggers. But instead of
                    challenging them, I just avoided social situations entirely. That pattern held until last year when
                    I went to Stockholm - where, for once, there was nowhere left to hide. I had to show up. I had to
                    take responsibility for how I lived.
                    <br><br>
                    This year, I’ve met a lot of people, but it’s only recently that I’ve figured out what actually
                    turns acquaintances into friends: showing up to the socials, being present, putting in the effort.
                    God, if I could redo just this final year... Should I do a Master’s just to finish what I’ve
                    started? To finally have the university experience I wanted all along?
                    <br><br>
                    So, like I said, I leave on Friday. Unfulfilled. And honestly, a bit heartbroken by all the
                    opportunities I didn’t see clearly until they were behind me. But at least now I know. I understand
                    that happiness doesn’t come from academic success or checking boxes - it comes from connection. From
                    people. And when I’m around the right ones, I feel more like myself than ever.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe I was only ever an introvert because I didn’t know any better. Now that I’ve seen what the
                    other side looks like, I’ve started to reevaluate everything. My goals. My approach. Even my sense
                    of self. I don’t know what the future holds, but I just hope that I don’t waste the same
                    opportunities I’ve done here.

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Sunday, 1st June</h2>
                <p>
                    Last night, I joined the DMU Running Society for a night out. After our run, the group was planning
                    to meet at Soar, and with the Champions League final on, I figured it was the perfect excuse to tag
                    along. Most of the guys were rooting for Inter, as was I, but - unsurprisingly - that dream didn’t
                    pan out. Still, the atmosphere was lively. It was the last social of the academic year, so the full
                    society turned up - around ten to fifteen of us in total. Most are final-year students, soon
                    scattering in different directions as they head off into post-university life.
                    <br><br>
                    After the match, we drifted to a cosy micro pub just around the corner called <em>The Castle</em>.
                    It's a student-run place, striking a brilliant balance between casual chaos and competent service.
                    You never wait long for a drink, yet the bar staff are unapologetically vibing to their own
                    playlists. At one point, <em>Hamilton</em> and <em>Les Mis</em> tracks came on, so I was well and
                    truly in my element. Because of its minute size, we sat on picnic benches in the adjoining garden,
                    just enjoying the conversation. Despite this being the first time meeting me, they were all very
                    convivial. I had been on two or three socials with them at the start of the year but I doubt they
                    would remember. My hair has tripled in length and my beard is unfortunately turning ginger. I regret
                    not making this group a priority at the start of the year because the people are so affable. I think
                    my final year could have been so different had I stuck with them.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in the night, we made our way to the ever-reliable <em>Firebug</em> - a venue I already knew
                    well from previous Hacker Society nights. As we approached the entrance, everyone around me was
                    asked for ID. I instinctively reached for my driver’s license, but before I could even produce it,
                    the bouncer clocked me, smiled, and said, <em>“Go on in, mate.”</em> Katie leaned over to tell me
                    the bouncers here are usually cold and officious, but not only was I waved through without question,
                    I was even called mate. Apparently, I now radiate the energy of a man clearly past student age. The
                    whole interaction hit me with a quiet finality - a neat little metaphor for this chapter closing.
                    I’m no longer just one of the students. That part of life is slipping into the rearview.

                    <em>Firebug</em> is a bit of a melting pot. You get all kinds in there: goths, creatives, gamers,
                    even the occasional foreigners. We ended up settling into a big table, playing card games like <em>Cheat</em>
                    and <em>Two-Up-Down</em> well into the early hours. To my surprise, I turned out to be a half-decent
                    bluffer and walked away with a couple of wins. But what really makes Firebug special is the gaming
                    setup - big screens and consoles set up right by the bar. We loaded up Mario Kart and let chaos
                    reign.
                    <br><br>
                    And maybe this is what maturity looks like - deliberately crashing into walls and driving off cliffs
                    to let others feel a little better about their pitiful karting skills. I know full well I could
                    dominate the game if I wanted to. But these days, the satisfaction of knowing I could is enough.
                    Winning isn’t always everything.
                    <br><br>
                    We left Firebug at around half past two, and - as tradition dictates - no night out is truly
                    complete without a pilgrimage to McDonald's. But I wasn’t quite ready to call it a night.
                    <br><br>
                    Abbey, fresh off celebrating her first university hacking competition, was across town at a club
                    called <em>Helsinki</em>. For those unfamiliar, it’s a gay bar. I’d never been, and I’ve never been
                    much of a clubber to begin with, but when Abbey invited me, I didn’t hesitate. I wanted to dance.
                    I’m 24, about to leave university next week, and - somewhat unbelievably - it was my first time ever
                    walking into a nightclub alone. It felt oddly liberating.
                    <br><br>
                    Helsinki was… an experience. My first time in a gay bar, and I’ll be honest: I wasn’t quite
                    prepared. I consider myself an open-minded, liberal person - accepting, curious, inclusive. But
                    nothing quite primes you for walking into a venue where people are pole-dancing in leather, humping
                    furniture, and wielding actual whips. It was sensory overload.
                    <br><br>
                    More than a club, Helsinki felt like a carnival of identities - a surreal, kaleidoscopic celebration
                    of queerness and expression. There were drag queens, trans people, transvestites, flamboyant
                    dancers, and yes, even a few characters that left me genuinely unsure whether I’d stumbled into a
                    Pride parade or a casting call for <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>. Pensioners lined the back wall, watching
                    young men dance. I found myself wondering - was this normal for Helsinki? Or just par for the course
                    in spaces where boundaries blur more freely?
                    <br><br>
                    While I’m used to checking for my phone, wallet, and keys on a night out, patrons here seemed to
                    double-check for muzzles, chains, and riding crops. It made me wonder: is fetish an inescapable part
                    of queer nightlife, or just a particularly bold thread in its fabric?
                    <br><br>
                    I navigated the dancefloor like a slalom course, ducking rogue elbows and avoiding stray leather
                    straps while scanning for Abbey. The crowd was eclectic - hen parties, stag dos, blokes in skirts,
                    girls in suits, and everyone in between. Eventually, I found Abbey in her element, dancing with her
                    friends, radiant and carefree. She doesn’t drink, so she was genuinely thrilled to see another sober
                    face in the sea of chaos.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I always thought I was a decent dancer - maybe even a little above average. But next to Abbey,
                    who’s had professional training, I looked like someone who’d just discovered rhythm this morning.
                    And next to the effortlessly expressive queer crowd? I didn’t just feel out of place - I felt like I
                    was auditioning badly for a part in a show I didn’t understand.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I loved it. Even with the older men lurking on the fringes. One even offered Abbey and me a
                    drink. I was thirsty - parched, really - but for some reason, I couldn’t even bring myself to ask
                    for water. Something in my head told me not to drink anything here.
                    <br><br>
                    We left at around 4 a.m., and although I hadn’t had a drop of alcohol, I felt intoxicated. It was
                    all so overwhelming, in the best possible way - a full-frontal assault of colour, sound, energy, and
                    freedom. Like walking into a Pride parade and suddenly realising you’re part of it. I walked Abbey
                    home - figured 4 a.m. is when the real creeps come out. Then again, maybe they were all already at
                    Helsinki.
                    <br><br>
                    In what is now my final week at university, I finally had a proper night out. And honestly, I’m so
                    glad I decided to go for that run, otherwise, none of this would’ve happened.

                    With all my coursework submitted and my viva complete, I found myself in a bit of a lull - waiting
                    around for something, though I wasn’t quite sure what. Eventually, I decided to join the DMU Running
                    Society for one of their sessions.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d gone on a few runs with them earlier in the year, but their running days often clashed with
                    football, which usually took priority. Looking back, it’s a bit of a shame. I’ve really enjoyed
                    playing football this year, but I think staying connected with a consistent group like the running
                    society could’ve added something different to my experience. I recognised the faces, though I
                    couldn’t put names to them. This evening’s run was about six miles - not particularly fast, more of
                    a relaxed, social pace. We looped around the outskirts of the city and finished through Victoria
                    Park. My legs feel okay for now, but I have a feeling tomorrow might tell a different story.

                <p>
                    12:02pm. Another step closer to the denouement of my university career. The Web Development
                    coursework was due two minutes ago. It wouldn’t have been a stressful morning had I not needed to
                    record a fifteen minute explanation video delineating my contributions to the project. I worked
                    individually so every file was created and modified by me. That means that I have around seventy
                    files, each as complex and comprehensive as the next and nowhere near enough time to explain them.
                    So I’ve had to be succinct with what I explained. Though I submitted the video, I still feel it
                    failed to capture the multifaceted logic and functions that make up the inner workings of the site.
                    I should get the results in a few weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    An aspect that I’m slightly wary of however; we have a shared folder where we needed to upload the
                    videos. I can only see three other submissions whereas there should be closer to ninety. There have
                    been frivolous rumours throughout this semester that we don’t actually need to complete all modules
                    in order to get a First Class degree. I, for instance, only need the minimum of 40% from Web Dev to
                    achieve my First overall. Realistically, I could bunk off the phase test next week and still pass
                    but why would I take that chance?

                    The only thing that could make a boiling day worse is a power cut. I’ve got coursework due midday
                    tomorrow and while it is mostly in hand, there are still a few tasks left to do. So I’ve been
                    working diligently today to try and get it done as expeditiously as possible before my Mac dies.
                    Thursday is normally the society socials but turns out this blackout has reached Soar Point as well
                    as most of the university buildings. Some of the lads have opted to go to another pub but the
                    general consensus among most of us is <em>‘fuck it - I’ve got too much work due in tomorrow. I’m
                    going home’. </em>So it’s a race between how fast our brains can think and how sparingly we can use
                    our battery life.

                    The last game of football before the end of the academic year. The usual Wednesday slot. Everyone
                    was in high spirits. Not because of the weather, but because the year is finally winding down. You
                    could feel it in the way people were greeting each other.
                    <br><br>
                    Teams, as always, were made on the spot. No captains, no tactics, no formality. Just luck of the
                    draw. This week it was like: Nigerians, Turks, Arabs, south Londoners, and Whites. I’m sure there’s
                    a dissertation in there somewhere. Something about postcolonial dynamics, urban multiculturalism, or
                    spontaneous ethnonational alliances in amateur sport. But honestly, no one cared, that’s just how it
                    worked out. We just wanted to play. Run around. It just reminded me of my time in Stockholm. No
                    matter how far away we go, we always gravitate to our own people.

                    The viva for the Final Year Project feels like the final piece of an intricate puzzle. Without it,
                    the entire module is incomplete - failure looms if this final hurdle isn’t cleared. Interestingly, a
                    piece of information passed down through the grapevine by Dilan sheds light on just how pivotal the
                    FYP really is: the grade achieved in the FYP often dictates the final classification of the entire
                    degree. For example, if someone is on track for a First across all other modules but secures only a
                    2:1 in their FYP, their overall grade may be capped at a 2:1. Given that the FYP is the magnum opus
                    of our university careers, it makes sense. But it’s frustrating that such a critical detail isn’t
                    made more transparent in the official module handbook or course documentation.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan, fortunately, is in a position where he seems to be privy to more than most - gleaning
                    insights from lecturers and module leaders. According to him, there are several other caveats not
                    publicly disclosed that significantly affect how we’re graded. While we are given marking criteria
                    to help shape our projects, that’s clearly just the tip of the iceberg. Having someone like Dilan to
                    demystify some of these unwritten rules is invaluable.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, turning to my own viva: it was a twenty-five-minute presentation conducted over Microsoft
                    Teams, where I had to explain and demonstrate my project to both my supervisor and an additional
                    marker. Speaking uninterrupted for that long is no easy task, but thankfully, my project is
                    substantial enough to sustain it. It features three distinct user privilege levels: admin users,
                    logged-in users, and general visitors. These different use cases and their associated functionality
                    provided plenty of material to discuss.
                    <br><br>
                    Feedback from my markers was overwhelmingly positive. They were especially impressed by the scale
                    and layout of the project - a common theme in their praise. As the first student to be assessed
                    (thanks to the project deadline falling on Friday and the bank holiday that followed), I’m relieved
                    to have it out of the way. Still, curiosity nags at me. I can’t help but wonder how my work measures
                    up against that of my peers. After all, it’s against them that my performance will ultimately be
                    judged.
                    <br><br>
                    If I had to grade myself, I’d say the presentation went well. I covered all the key features, and
                    even if I didn’t explain every detail, I made sure to show every page I had developed. I handled the
                    questions competently, though I do wish I had articulated one of the debugging features a little
                    better. I’m hoping Salimah might follow up with some detailed feedback, but realistically, I suspect
                    I’ll have to wait until the grades are ratified and released - likely sometime in June.
                    <br><br>
                    Because I have finished my largest project to date, I didn’t feel like jumping straight back in with
                    my web project due Friday. I’ve done most of the functionality for it anyway, I only need to improve
                    the user interface and then I’m finished. So to celebrate, I headed to Soar Point. I don’t even
                    drink and yet it’s becoming my <em>local</em>. Dilan was there for our weekly meeting because he’s
                    not had his viva yet and wanted the heads up on what to expect.
                    <br><br>
                    The rest of the Hackers were also there doing their weekly CTF challenges which is basically a more
                    advanced level than the challenges they do in the Hackers sessions on Thursday evenings. I ended up
                    staying all afternoon since I knew most of them anyway - <em>and Abbey wouldn’t let me leave.</em>
                    She’s joining the committee next year since she’ll be a second year Cyber student. Normally the
                    hackers are too focused on their projects to be sociable but everyone's in the same position as me
                    so
                    they are more than welcome to a conversation now they're not stressed with work.

                    I’ve been programming for most of the day, buried deep in code, with the deadline for the Web
                    Project looming like a storm cloud. After over ten hours of relentless screen-staring, my eyes were
                    square (and wonky) so I needed to take a break. I headed over to Soar Point where the Racers were
                    having their (probably last) social of the year. Given I could see both sides of the room
                    simultaneously, I tried not to look anyone in the eye until my eyes straightened up. The problems I
                    have to face…
                    <br><br>
                    We got talking about <em>Mobland</em>, that new Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan series, and somehow
                    drifted onto gangster films.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“Has anyone seen this really old film called Snatch?”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Old?! It’s from 2000! That comment hit harder than I expected. These children are clearly not my
                    generation. This is probably why some adults resent younger people - not because of their energy or
                    their optimism, but because they’re a constant reminder of just how out of touch we’re becoming.
                    Thankfully, Curtis and James, the team leaders, showed up and joined me since they’d seen a few more
                    winters than most. I guess we oldies just gravitate towards each other.
                    <br><br>
                    We moved on to older gangster films - <em>Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale.</em> Some didn’t even know who
                    Robert De Niro was. I didn’t dare bring up <em>The Godfather.</em> I wasn’t ready for any more blows
                    to my sense of cultural relevance.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“Now kids, let me tell you about the good ol’ days - a time when we had to rewind tapes, phones
                        had buttons, Toys R Us and Woolworths were having sales, and the Argos catalogue was basically
                        the Holy Grail.”</em>

                    Was in Soar watching the F1 with Abbey and Mae. Because Monaco is known for its glamour, and
                    unfortunately not for entertaining racing, we had our own version of Bingo on the go. We all picked
                    things we were expecting to happen, i.e, red flag, Le Clerc to take Pole, Stroll to hit a wall, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Because it was such a mundane race, not one of us called Bingo. The FIA introduced the mandatory two
                    pitstop rule only for this weekend in an effort to make it more entertaining. Shame it didn’t help.
                    Most finished in the position they finished qualifying in. My prediction is Monaco will be taken off
                    the calendar by 2030 since the only jeopardy in Monte Carlo happens if it rains.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, it’s good to get out of my room. Although everyone is busy with coursework, dissertations and
                    revision - we have all reserved Sunday’s off to meet up for the Formula One until we all leave for
                    the summer. In terms of who’s going when. Mae has a summer internship at DMU so she’s not going back
                    to London until late July. Abbey is heading off on the 7th to spend two months running a summer camp
                    in the states. Amy’s final deadline is the 6th so she’ll be joining the mass exodus from Leicester
                    sometime in the week after. I’m still undecided on when to leave. I could do my internship here
                    since I’ve got my room until late July. I’ll probably be more productive here too, especially since
                    I have the entire flat to myself with Ash going back to Qatar in the next few weeks too.

                <h2>Saturday, 24th May</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s 5am. I wanted to go to bed five hours ago. But the night I casually agreed to join turned into
                    a full-blown extravaganza. Now I’m back - my ears still pounding - and I can’t sleep until my hair
                    dries from the rain. So here I am, writing instead of coding or reading, because if I start coding
                    now, I’ll be up till dawn. And that’s not good for anybody.
                    <br><br>
                    Tonight was the end-of-year party at the O2. No, not the London Arena - the auditorium on the
                    University of Leicester campus. UoL have finished all their exams, so they’re already celebrating.
                    At DMU, we’ve still got two more weeks before we can even think about partying.
                    <br><br>
                    I went with Ash and Esther. We’re calling this Flat 101’s leaving party since it’s probably going to
                    be the first and last time we all go out. Because of that reason, I wasn’t sure what to expect from
                    them.
                    <br><br>
                    Like me, Esther doesn’t drink, so we decided to meet Ash and Mansi at the club instead of joining
                    the pre-drinks. Esther actually goes to UoL, so I just followed her there. The club night itself had
                    more of a school disco vibe than anything adult-themed, but we made it work. Ash, who had been
                    drinking since around 7 PM, was only around for about half an hour after we got there around 1 AM.
                    No worries though - Esther and I danced until the very end.
                    <br><br>
                    She’s a fantastic dancer. I’ve realised I’m most confident when I’m around confident people. While
                    the crowd stuck to that awkward head-bob-and-hands-up shuffle, Esther and I were there to actually
                    dance. I’m pretty sure we looked like Ross and Monica doing "the routine," but we were enjoying
                    ourselves, and that’s all that mattered.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s ironic. Only now, at the end of my university career, do I feel the urge to go out, to
                    experience the nights I’ve spent years avoiding. I finally have simpatico people around me - genial,
                    intrepid friends outside of Computer Science who make nights like this worthwhile.
                    <br><br>
                    I wrote in a blog a while back about Paris - that I went because of the people. I never expected it
                    to go so well. I also said that people brave enough to travel tend to be more convivial. They know
                    how to socialise. Though I didn’t meet her in Paris, Esther is one of those people. It’s a shame
                    she’s leaving today to go home. I’m glad we had this one night before she disappears into the sea of
                    people I’ll probably never see again.
                    <br><br>
                    What surprised me most tonight was how many familiar faces I saw. For someone who has spent most of
                    this year preserving my introverted reputation, avoiding the pubs and clubs, I somehow recognised so
                    many people. And they recognised me - karters, racers, footballers, even some acquaintances from
                    Paris.
                    <br><br>
                    It was an unexpected night, but a good one. I’m glad I went.

                <p>
                    The deadline for the Final Year Project is midday. I’ve had my coding aspects completed for over a
                    month and the literary components wrapped up last week but I still have this overwhelming
                    inclination that I’ve forgotten to submit something. A stray test case, a section of appendices, the
                    database configuration. Something…
                    <br><br>
                    Everything’s been checked by my supervisor so a paltry weight has been lifted but it’s a peculiar
                    feeling. Four months worth of work, completed, over. Done
                    <br><br>
                    Now to celebrate, I’ve been working on the web project and now I’ve solved that huge problem I had
                    yesterday, I’m making great progress. I am shattered given the long hours I’ve spent
                    working and my eyes are very wonky but once this work is done, then I am within touching
                    distance of the finish line.

                <h2>Thursday, 22nd May</h2>
                <p>
                    The sun is shining and I’m in a shroud of ennui. The type of melancholic boredom that creeps in when
                    life is too still, too quiet. There’s a world outside - warm, glowing, alive - but here I am,
                    indoors, staring at lines of code that mock me with their stoic logic.
                    <br><br>
                    I've nothing interesting to do but code.
                    <br><br>
                    To the uninitiated, that probably sounds like a contradiction. Isn’t building something from scratch
                    supposed to be fulfilling? Isn’t programming the modern equivalent of wizardry, conjuring worlds
                    from nothing but logic and caffeine?
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes. But also, not really.
                    <br><br>
                    No one outside of programming circles quite understands the emotional rollercoaster that begins the
                    moment you open a blank IDE window. It starts off innocently: “This’ll be cool.” Then quickly
                    descends into the void: “Why isn’t this working?” You Google. You stack overflow. You curse. You
                    comment out chunks of code like you're performing surgery with a blindfold on.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, somehow, something clicks. A missing semicolon. An off-by-one error. A race condition
                    unravelled like some cosmic joke. And suddenly, the bug that's been eating your soul for hours
                    vanishes. That moment. That brief flash of dopamine. That’s what keeps us coming back. It’s not the
                    product, it’s not the end goal - it’s that single, euphoric beat of “Oh my god, it works.” It’s both
                    triumph and relief, like finishing a puzzle with a piece you were certain was missing.
                    <br><br>
                    Then it’s back to the loop. Write. Break. Fix. Repeat.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside, people are sunbathing in the park. Inside, I’m tweaking a function that calculates pixel
                    spacing with almost religious devotion. And yet, this is where I am. This is what I’ve chosen. I
                    guess that's the beauty and curse of coding - it's lonely, frustrating, recursive… but just when
                    you're about to quit, it rewards you with a moment of clarity that feels like creation. And then it
                    all starts again.
                    <br><br>
                    So yeah - the sun is shining. But I’m stuck inside, quietly losing my mind.

                    My final supervisor meeting concluded this morning. Less than three minutes long. My report has
                    reached its denouement, my codebase works and is somewhat tidy. There’s nothing left to discuss with
                    Salimah. I’ve submitted the notes and that’s worth 10% of my grade - somehow. I guess I should start
                    my other web development project. Most of which I’m expecting I can copy from my FYP since they
                    follow the same sort of structure.

                    Following our successful photoshoot last Thursday, Mansi and Ash accompanied me through the streets
                    of Leicester so I can try out some new camera settings and also a few new techniques that I’ve read
                    up about. Photography is about the only thing that I’m enjoying these days. Partly because I have
                    the Web Development coursework due at the end of the month and I’m yet to start it. Photography is a
                    great way of procrastinating. Also I’m reading my first fantasy book recommended to me by Tilly. Not
                    normally my go-to genre but apparently this is the hook into all things mystical. I’ll let you know…

                <p>
                    Didn’t fancy watching the FA cup alone in my room so I called upon the only other guy in the
                    Computing faculty who’s into football. And she’s not even a guy.
                    <br><br>
                    Abbey’s a die-hard Preston North End fan, which meant she was rooting for Crystal Palace - anything
                    to see the Mancunian rivals lose. From our time in Paris, I’d already pegged her as a bit of a
                    tomboy. She studies cyber-security (still very much a boys' club), is seriously into sports, and has
                    been a huge F1 fan since before it became cool in 2017. She also follows darts religiously,
                    especially local legends like Nathan Aspinall and Luke Littler - fellow North-West natives.
                    <br><br>
                    Back in Paris, when I was making small talk, I asked about her parents. She told me they both worked
                    for Preston FC. I guessed admin or steward roles, and she didn’t correct me. Turns out that was a
                    bit of a fallacy.
                    <br><br>
                    Now that we’re closer - no longer just acquaintances abroad - she let the truth slip. Her dad?
                    Preston’s club secretary. Top of the admin ladder. Her mum? The club’s accountant. So yeah, her
                    family basically runs the place behind the scenes.
                    <br><br>
                    We ended up spending the afternoon together, kicking things off with F1 qualifying before diving
                    into the FA Cup. Abbey had a whole arsenal of behind-the-scenes stories, especially about her dad’s
                    proximity to celebrity. When big concerts happen at Deepdale, he’s up in the private boxes with free
                    tickets - Elton John, Mick Jagger, etc, etc. Abbey’s going to a Beyoncé gig this summer thanks to
                    him. On top of that, he gets free gear from Castore, Preston’s kit manufacturer.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I’m not in the market for a Preston kit - but Castore also makes the McLaren F1 team uniforms.
                    And Abbey’s dad, Ben Rhodes, has the connections to get whatever merch he wants.
                    <br><br>
                    With my birthday around the corner, I may have dropped a subtle hint to Abbey…

                    Weekly lunch with Amy. At this point, it’s one of the few constants. Everyone else has been buried
                    under dissertations, final deadlines, and a general sense of academic doom, so no one’s really able
                    to come out and play. It’s just the two of us now, squeezing in a bit of normality between the
                    chaos.
                    <br><br>
                    We ate at a halal chicken place this time. I’ve known I’m a bit of a culinary coward -
                    unintentionally boxed in by my own food prejudices. I try to play it safe, ordering dishes I think I
                    know, but they’re never quite prepared the way my tragically plain palate is used to. The flavours
                    are unfamiliar, the textures surprising. And so, inevitably, I end up disliking the food - not
                    because it’s bad, but because it’s not what I expected. Which, ironically, is entirely my fault.
                    <br><br>
                    Midway through the meal, Amy got a phone call and abruptly stood up, storming outside before I could
                    piece together what was going on. A few minutes later, she came back in, beaming. That job she
                    applied for at Mercedes - five months ago, when it felt like more of a shot in the dark than a real
                    possibility - she got it. She’ll be working in the Bicester office. Not quite London, which is
                    disappointing from a selfish point of view, but still - it’s Mercedes. It’s what she’s been working
                    toward all year. I couldn’t be prouder.
                    <br><br>
                    To celebrate, I took her bowling. I probably should’ve gone easy on her, but I didn’t. First game
                    was a warm-up. I won by ten points or so. Second game, though? I was locked in. Four strikes, a
                    final score just under 180. I was quietly smug about it, even if it was meant to be her victory lap.
                    <br><br>
                    Afterwards, we wandered around town, talking about everything and nothing, then I walked her home.
                    Next week, she’s taking me to a Vietnamese restaurant. Which means another adventure for my
                    extremely limited palate.<em>Great.</em>

                    Someone - Ash, obviously - didn’t close the freezer properly, so it started defrosting. Ice had
                    formed into a solid sheet at the base, meaning the bottom drawer wouldn’t slide in all the way. And
                    because the drawer wouldn’t go in, the door wouldn’t seal, which meant we were slowly losing the
                    cold and heading toward full fridge meltdown. It wasn’t quite worth bothering maintenance about -
                    too minor, too domestic - and even if we did report it, we’d probably be waiting a week for someone
                    to show up with a screwdriver and a shrug.
                    <br><br>
                    So I did what any mildly responsible, mildly bored student would do: I filled both pans with boiling
                    water and placed them in the foot of the freezer like a makeshift glacier-melting ritual. Half an
                    hour later, standing in a slowly spreading pool of water, the iceberg was no more. The drawer slid
                    in smoothly, the door sealed shut, and just like that, the crisis was over. Now, every time I walk
                    into the kitchen, I open and close the freezer door just to admire my handiwork. Very niche domestic
                    pride, but still.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s also been a while since I’ve taken any proper photos. Ash and Mansi are basically
                    quasi-influencers - they’re always making reels and staging shoots with professional-grade lighting
                    for their socials. Neither of them actually studied photography in their Media degrees, which makes
                    their confidence in front of the camera even more impressive. I tagged along with them this evening
                    to sharpen my own skills - less about content creation, more about improving my craft.
                    <br><br>
                    A few hundred shots later, I got what I wanted: clean, sharp images with a bit of atmosphere. It was
                    nearly 11 p.m. when Mansi decided to flip the lens on me. And there I was, in the middle of the
                    street, posing and half-laughing in Ash’s oversized coat, suddenly part of the aesthetic instead of
                    behind it.
                    <br><br>
                    Turns out, I’m just as vain as the rest of them. The photos went straight on Instagram.

                    looked so much like her, it threw me off. If you don’t know who that is, she played Maia Rindell in
                    <em>The Good Fight</em> and is married to Kit Harington. Anyway, for the past few days, my fob
                    hasn’t been working, which means I haven’t been able to lock my room. Not ideal. Luckily, I trust my
                    roommates enough to not panic about things going missing.
                    <br><br>
                    Not that there’s much activity in the flat anyway. Apparently, Summer’s already gone back to Leeds -
                    finishing the rest of the year from home and only returning for exams. I do wonder if she’ll mind me
                    working through her stash of pasta and ketchup. I’m hoping not. Esther, on the other hand, is
                    supposedly still around, but I haven’t seen her in over a week either. Ash is staying at Mansi’s so
                    for all I know, I could have the place to myself and not even realise it.

                <p>
                    I’m desperate for some kind of stimuli. Anything, really. It’s a gorgeous day - sun blazing, sky
                    cloudless - and yet everyone’s holed up indoors, buried under dissertations and final reports. I’m
                    no exception. I still have coursework to finish, but with the weather this good, all I want is to be
                    outside with my camera, chasing light and moments. Instead, I’m stuck in this internal tug-of-war:
                    guilt pulling me toward my desk, instinct pulling me into the sun.
                    <br><br>
                    So I compromised. I packed up my laptop and headed to campus, figuring I could at least change the
                    setting if not the situation. I found a quiet spot in the Vijay Patel building, on the floor with
                    the balcony that overlooks the gardens. It’s not exactly a study haven, but it gave me the illusion
                    of being outdoors without fully abandoning my responsibilities.
                    <br><br>
                    As expected, the actual work I got done was minimal - just enough to pretend I was being productive.
                    But even minor progress feels like a win these days. Just enough to stave off the guilt, just enough
                    to justify the sunshine.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, I finally finished the Easter egg I brought back from the North. It lasted longer
                    than expected, but now it’s gone and I’ve got a newly developed sweet tooth demanding a replacement.
                    The craving is real - and unfortunately, so is the lack of chocolate.

                    Four months of work. 9,462 words. 61 pages. My FYP report is finally complete. Salimah’s going to
                    look over it for any mistakes or omissions, but for all intents and purposes, it’s done. That’s
                    forty percent of the grade accounted for. Another forty comes from the application itself. The
                    remaining twenty is split - ten percent from documentation, and the final ten from the viva: a
                    half-hour presentation of my working application.
                    <br><br>
                    Like previous presentations, I’m not too worried. It’s mostly just a guided tour of the website -
                    demonstrating the features, explaining the design choices. Nothing too daunting.
                    <br><br>
                    This week’s meeting with Salimah lasted less than five minutes. I’ve ticked off everything on the
                    list, but these weekly check-ins are mandatory if you want full marks - otherwise, no one would
                    bother. Once I’ve made the minor changes she suggested, next week’s meeting will be a full
                    runthrough of the site, a dress rehearsal for the viva. It’s not scheduled until June, but it’ll be
                    my last session with her, so I want to make it count.

                <p>
                    Who doesn’t love a day at the fair? I went two years ago with Natalia and Emily and thought it would
                    be a fun way to spend a Saturday instead of screaming at the football because fantasy has let me
                    down. <em>Again.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    This time, Amy came along, and honestly, any day I get to see someone from Paris tends to be a
                    highlight. But with exam season looming, coursework deadlines and revision schedules are hanging
                    over us like a dark cloud, so outings like this will probably be few and far between for a while.
                    Mae had planned to come too, but the sheer mountain of work she’s behind on caught up with her.
                    <br><br>
                    The fair itself was a bit of a letdown. It felt shrunken somehow - fewer rides, hardly any food
                    stalls, and not a ferris wheel in sight. Mostly just a scattering of game booths, a couple of
                    sad-looking carousels, and a row of food trucks. There wasn’t much to do, really, so we just
                    wandered. Talked. People-watched. Dodged overly enthusiastic kids and half-hearted balloon sellers.
                    The kind of afternoon that felt less like an event and more like background noise for a good
                    conversation.
                    <br><br>
                    Amy and I aren’t thrill-seekers like Natalia, so the lack of rides didn’t bother us too much. We
                    picked at overpriced snacks and just let the day unfold without any real agenda.
                    <br><br>
                    True to form, and true to my Paris myopia, I forgot to wear sunscreen. Several hours later, my skin
                    is reminding me of that with every movement.

                <h2>Friday, 9th May</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve spent the last five days voraciously reading a coming-of-age novel, hoping it might spark some
                    inspiration for the impasse I’ve hit in my own writing. Little Sister Song, as it's called, is
                    currently in the Kindle top ten - which is baffling, because it’s easily the worst book I’ve read
                    since my pandemic-era reading renaissance. I’ve read poorly written books. I’ve read stories that
                    were painfully linear and predictable. This one managed to be both, while also lacking a real
                    antagonist, a central conflict, or even a reason to care. No raison d’être. No modus vivendi.
                    Nothing to chew on - no tension, no twist, no thorn among the roses. Four hundred pages, and I can
                    summarise the plot in five sentences. In fact, I will:
                    <br><br>
                    Two sisters escape a cult in Arizona and head to their brothers’ place in Washington. The younger
                    sister enjoys it there and wants to stay, but social services step in and assign her a foster
                    parent. She rebels and runs away. The brothers track her down. They get ice cream. That’s it.
                    <br><br>
                    So many loose ends, it’s almost comical. It’s the first of a fifteen-book series, yet nothing of
                    substance actually happens. I went into this hoping to unearth a new thread of ideas - something,
                    anything I could use - but it’s been a completely futile exercise. And the fact that this ranks
                    among the top ten Kindle books this week only underscores how contrived and hollow those ratings
                    really are.

                <h2>Wednesday, 7th May</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve been accepted onto a Master’s degree at De Montfort. Slightly odd, considering I never actually
                    applied.
                    <br><br>
                    Today was the first time I’ve made it to my Web Dev seminars since coming back from Easter. Last
                    week, I had interviews scheduled at the worst possible times, so I missed all my classes. In both of
                    today’s lectures, only three people showed up. Three. It’s absurd. The university insists on
                    attendance, throws out threats about consequences if we don’t show up, and yet here we are - sat in
                    a theatre built for three hundred, attended by the three who could be bothered to get out of bed.
                    <br><br>
                    I can’t entirely blame people either. We're not being taught. Our sessions feel more like a primary
                    school story time - just with fewer pictures. The lecturer reads directly off the PowerPoint slides,
                    word for word. No elaboration, no explanation, no interaction. Of course no one’s motivated to
                    attend.
                    <br><br>
                    The teaching is virtually non-existent, and yet when we turn to AI to actually <em>learn</em>
                    something, it’s met with disapproval. Knowing a subject and knowing how to teach it are two entirely
                    different things. Most lecturers fall squarely into the former category - which is of no use to us
                    whatsoever.

                <h2>Tuesday, 6th May</h2>
                <p>
                    I had a screening call for an IT & Web Developer position in London. It was just an introductory
                    chat - a recruiter asking about my tech stack, motivations, future plans, the usual. I seemed to
                    tick all their boxes and came across as an “ideal candidate,” apparently. So they’re passing my
                    details on. We’ll see where it goes.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan and I have a weekly meeting to talk through our Final Year Projects. I’m writing up the
                    dissertation now, and I’ve nearly finished. I’m within the word count, with just one section left to
                    write. I still need to refactor my codebase, which is a bit of a wildcard task considering how many
                    files there are - but I’m well within reach of hitting my targets.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan wrapped up most of his programming over Easter. His project is a mobile app for shift
                    management: much more succinct than mine, but his codebase is far more complex. Given that his
                    magnum opus is around security, he’s made the app borderline impenetrable - just in case the secret
                    service ever comes knocking.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s not as far along with the report as I am, but his insight is always valuable. He knows how to
                    structure an academic document properly, thanks to his year at IBM. Meanwhile, I’m in this weird
                    grey area. I could either focus on writing a comprehensive report - even if some of it ends up
                    sounding a bit facile - or I could follow Dilan’s advice: only highlight the interesting aspects,
                    and skip the stuff that any technically minded reader would be able to infer.
                    <br><br>
                    Ideally, I’d strike a balance between the two - but doing that will probably push me over the
                    10,000-word limit.
                    <br><br>
                    Next, I had a meeting with Jim Shirley, the CEO of FundingHero, where I’ll be doing my summer
                    internship. I know it’s a small bugbear, but punctuality has always been drilled into me as
                    something essential. Both meetings I’ve had today? The people who scheduled them turned up over five
                    minutes late. I get that I’m not employed yet, but I still have things to do - and I don’t enjoy
                    sitting around waiting.
                    <br><br>
                    FundingHero is an entrepreneurial consultancy. They don’t invest directly but work with startups to
                    get them ready for seed funding - shaping business plans, tightening pitches, making companies more
                    attractive to investors. This meeting was just an introductory chat with Jim, as my previous
                    conversation had been with someone else: Josh Woods. He’s since left the company for a lecturing
                    role at Lancashire University.
                    <br><br>
                    I think there were supposed to be three interns on the call, but it ended up just being me and a
                    second-year student named Ola. I’m not even sure she’s from De Montfort - she was wearing a
                    Loughborough netball hoodie, so make of that what you will.
                    <br><br>
                    From what Josh had said previously, the plan was to hire two interns: one AI-focused software
                    developer and one business graduate. I originally applied for the AI role, but Josh mentioned they
                    were opening up a new position for a web developer to help implement features on their website.
                    Given that my FYP is a web app, that seemed like a natural fit.
                    <br><br>
                    However, on the call, it became clear that Jim hadn’t been told any of this. So, he’s currently
                    assigned me to work on refining the AI chatbot results for their site - possibly because, during
                    introductions, I had a decent portfolio of final-year projects to talk about. In contrast, Ola
                    didn’t say much. From what I gathered, she’s more of a graphic designer than a programmer. The only
                    project she mentioned was designing a website - singular - and not building it. She did a data
                    analysis internship last year, but her communication wasn’t great. A lot of one-word answers.
                    <br><br>
                    That said, she does fit the stereotypical “software dev” mould - bad at talking to people, good at
                    talking to machines. I’m curious to see more of her work and find out if she’s actually got the
                    skills.
                    <br><br>
                    So, to sum it up: I’ve been handed the tougher job because I’ve got the more technical background.
                    Meanwhile, Ola’s already playing the power game.
                    <br><br>
                    After the meeting, I rushed into town. The Paris group were having a little reunion at Frankie &
                    Benny’s, followed by a trip next door to Showcase to see <em>Sinners</em>. Seven out of twelve
                    RSVP’d. I invited Tilly - who I met Sunday night at Soar Point - since she’d mentioned wanting to
                    see <em>Sinners</em>, or more accurately, Michael B. Jordan.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d read some reviews beforehand, and <em>Sinners</em> was generally well received. It was billed as
                    a thriller, <em>not</em> a horror - which completely shifted my expectations. I spent the first half
                    of the film bracing for jump scares that never came. Thankfully, there weren’t many, and once I
                    adjusted, I actually enjoyed it. The movie was solid.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone else I went with was younger, which meant they were already complaining about the
                    two-and-a-half-hour runtime. No attention span, that lot. Personally, I thought it flew by. I did
                    almost jump out of my seat when a vampire appeared out of nowhere - but other than that, no
                    complaints. Solid 8/10.

                <p>
                    It’s a bank holiday, which meant I had three options: use the time to get uni work done, make the
                    most of the free day, or treat it like an extra holiday. I’ve got a report to write and a web
                    development project due at the end of the month - but naturally, I ignored all of that and
                    binge-watched a six-part miniseries: <em>The Flatshare.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    It’s not usually my kind of TV, but I’d read the book and was curious to see how they adapted it.
                    Verdict? The book is <em>unequivocally</em> better. In almost every possible way.
                    <br><br>
                    The show streamlines the story and leans heavily into the emotional beats, glossing over all the
                    little details that made the book worth reading. It barely compares. Huge sections were cut, and the
                    best chapter - literally the reason I wanted to watch the show - was reduced to a footnote so they
                    could shift focus to the other character’s arc. Criminal.
                    <br><br>
                    This is exactly why I don’t bother with TV adaptations anymore. I’ve just lost six hours of my life
                    I’m never getting back.

                    Now that I’ve shared my photos from Paris, I get a little hit of pride whenever I see one pop up on
                    someone’s Instagram. It’s a small sign I’m not a total amateur behind the camera. Some of the shots
                    are actually good. Admittedly, it’s probably 5% of everything I shared - but still, there’s
                    something there. A spark of talent, maybe.
                    <br><br>
                    The F1 was in Miami this weekend, and where better to watch it than the hub of all societies: Soar
                    Point. Mae’s a die-hard Ferrari fan, so she’s my go-to for watching the Grand Prix. She’s got a soft
                    spot for Leclerc and a quiet disappointment about Hamilton joining Ferrari - only to underperform.
                    Red Bull are the villains, and Max Verstappen is the enemy. My loyalties are simple: any British
                    driver gets my support. That’s enough for me.
                    <br><br>
                    It was the first time I’d seen Mae since Paris, so like the catch-up with Amy earlier in the week,
                    there was plenty to talk about.
                    <br><br>
                    Tilly, Mae’s housemate, came along too - mainly for a change of scene. She’s a bit like me when it
                    comes to socialising: needs to feel comfortable before getting involved. She brought her book as
                    backup, just in case. She’s from Norwich and proud of it - well-spoken, friendly, easy to chat to.
                    <br><br>
                    McLaren pulled off a 1-2 finish, and even the DMU Racing Society - who always seem to occupy the
                    balcony by the exit - looked genuinely happy about it. So I guess this is where I’ll be watching the
                    F1 for the rest of my time at uni.

                <h2>Saturday, 3rd May</h2>
                <p>
                    I prefer half-twelve kick-offs. Especially when the train journey’s under an hour - that’s a bonus.
                    The Ricoh Arena, as I knew it growing up, feels like the kind of football stadium a kid would
                    design. No overlapping tiers or luxury boxes. Just four straightforward stands, filled top to bottom
                    with seats. The Boro fans were tucked into the South Stand, right behind the goal. Classic.
                    <br><br>
                    Of the five away games I’ve been to this season, Coventry had the best atmosphere by far. Maybe it
                    was the playoff anticipation. Maybe it was just the buzz of the final day. But there was something
                    electric in that away end - almost tangible. That belief that we could do it. Football optimism, eh?
                    There’s never a lost cause while someone’s still fighting.
                    <br><br>
                    Scores from around the league were being shouted across the stands. At one point, we were hearing
                    that if we just drew, both us and Coventry would sneak into the playoffs. I was messaging Abbey,
                    who’s a Preston fan - they were scrapping at the other end of the table, fighting relegation.
                    Coincidentally, they were playing Bristol City, who were also chasing the playoffs. It was all
                    lining up perfectly: Preston 2-0 up, and the other results going our way too.
                    <br><br>
                    But, of course, we couldn’t perform when it mattered. I’ve watched the highlights since, and it
                    looked like an even game - or at least felt like one from the stand. That said, we only started
                    stringing passes together and pushing forward after going a goal down. That’s something that has to
                    change next season. Still, the players got a warm reception at full time. Most of the frustration
                    was aimed at Carrick.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“It’s happened again, it’s happened againnnn. Michael Carrick. It’s happened again!”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    The train back to Leicester was full of Boro fans, and we’re a truly miserable bunch. <em>“Better to
                    lose now than limp into the playoffs,”</em> someone muttered. Is it though? Really?
                    <br><br>
                    I was home by mid-afternoon, still with most of the day ahead. Naturally, I spent it wallowing. Made
                    a shepherd’s pie and didn’t leave my room. Still reeling from what could’ve been. To distract
                    myself, I managed to finish another section of my dissertation report - which somehow felt more
                    depressing than the football.

                <h2>Friday, 2nd May</h2>
                <p>
                    When friends want to catch up, I always go for an activity - mini golf, a walk in the park, a game
                    of pool at the pub. Something to focus on while chatting. Lunch dates? I avoid them like the plague.
                    I’m not a great conversationalist, and I’m definitely not confident eating meals in public with
                    people I’m not completely at ease with. So when Amy suggested lunch last week, I was resigned - but
                    not about to say no.
                    <br><br>
                    One saving grace: she let me pick the café. I chose St Martin’s, a traditional English spot with an
                    eclectic menu - enough to satisfy my plain tastes while still giving Amy room to explore her more
                    adventurous ones.
                    <br><br>
                    Amy’s probably the person I spent the most time with in Paris - we were on the same team. She
                    indulged my photo-taking habits and took me clubbing, something I enjoyed more than I thought I
                    would. Because of all that time together, she at least <em>kind of</em> understands my eating
                    quirks.
                    <br><br>
                    So lunch wasn’t the disaster I’d feared. I finished my food. Amy’s easy company - genial, and a
                    great raconteur. She always has a story, and she never takes herself too seriously. We’re also both
                    in our final year after taking a year out, which makes a big difference. There’s a lot we share that
                    others might not get.
                    <br><br>
                    After lunch, we went shopping. I’m growing my hair out, so I figured I might as well do it right.
                    Proper shampoo, conditioner, even mousse to fight the frizz. Amy told me that’s what I needed, so
                    that’s what I got. Easy.
                    <br><br>
                    Clothes shopping with a girl was a different kind of experience - like seeing behind enemy lines. I
                    know I don’t have amazing style. I’m not trying to make a fashion statement every time I leave the
                    house. But I don’t think I dress <em>badly</em> either. I walk that fine line, I think. Amy’s take
                    on my outfits was... interesting. Seeing my choices through her eyes was new. I imagine it was a bit
                    strange for her too, hearing my thoughts on her dresses and style. Not sure if she was being polite
                    or actually liked what I said.
                    <br><br>
                    The most unexpected part of the day happened in John Lewis. We were browsing the hand soaps, and
                    they have a sink in-store. I tried some of the scrubs and salts - my hands have never felt so soft.
                    Also, Dyson hair products are nearly £500. That was wild. Very grateful to be a lad who doesn’t have
                    to care about that kind of stuff.

                <h2>Wednesday, 30th April</h2>
                <p>
                    Out of 240 applicants, I was fortunate to be longlisted for the Researcher internship at
                    Dragonfly
                    Productions - one of just thirty.
                    <br><br>
                    The first step in the process was an hour-long introductory session with a recruitment agency.
                    We
                    were told upfront that the session wouldn’t factor into the decision-making process - it was
                    simply
                    a meet-and-greet, with two mock interview questions and some very brief feedback. While helpful
                    for
                    practicing answers, it ultimately felt more symbolic than substantial.
                    <br><br>
                    There were only ten of us in the session, each given three minutes to introduce ourselves and
                    explain why we wanted the role. It was a diverse group - some already working in publishing,
                    others
                    (like me) on the cusp of graduation. If I were the one hiring, I’d probably lean toward
                    experience
                    over academic credentials, but you never know what qualities stand out on the day.
                    <br><br>
                    Afterward, I made my way to the Vijay Patel building - arguably the most scenic on campus,
                    complete
                    with a balcony view. I intended to get some work done, but Amy (from the Paris trip) joined me,
                    and
                    that quickly turned into our first proper catch-up since returning. Not the most productive
                    afternoon, but a worthwhile one.
                    <br><br>
                    I had to leave the session prematurely - not out of disinterest, but because I had plans to see
                    <em>Pride
                        & Prejudice</em> with Abbey, another Paris compatriot. It was the twentieth anniversary
                    screening of
                    the 2005 film, starring Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy.
                    A
                    classic in every sense.
                    <br><br>
                    To hear Jane Austen’s prose brought to life on screen is a reminder of just how rich and
                    piercing
                    language can be. The elegance of the dialogue, the sharpness of the repartee - it’s something I
                    envy
                    deeply as a writer.
                    <br><br>
                    Keira Knightley’s delivery in particular transforms Elizabeth’s lines into something ethereal.
                    There’s one scene that always stays with me - Elizabeth, wounded but resolute, confronting
                    Darcy:
                    <br><br><em>
                    “From the very beginning -your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of
                    others - made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon
                    to
                    marry.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    The rhythm of that sentence, the control beneath the fury - it’s arguably one of the greatest
                    deliveries of classical literature adapted for screen.
                    <br><br>
                    If only we all had that command of language in moments that mattered.
                    <br><br>
                    Abbey and I were giggling like children throughout. There was something beautifully indulgent
                    about
                    it - a shared nostalgia and giddy admiration. And we weren’t alone; the rest of the cinema felt
                    just
                    the same. Only fervent cinephiles would spend their evening watching a twenty-year-old
                    adaptation of
                    a two-hundred-year-old novel - mouthing the lines, laughing before the punchlines, and
                    collectively
                    swooning at Mr. Darcy’s awkward sincerity.

                    I’m back in Leicester after a fortnight in the North. Two weeks of editing photos and writing
                    half a
                    dissertation, is onerous. With the weather being so hot and humid, I locked the doors and spent
                    the
                    afternoon in the lounge distracting Esther from revising. As she’s also graduating next month
                    but
                    has to pass four formal exams to determine her grade. My degree is formatted so I know already
                    that
                    I only need to complete the bare minimum in order to get my 1st from my coursework. Ash is
                    always
                    pleased to see me. She welcomed me back with her usual joie de vivre. As an international
                    student
                    she has no exams to cram for so I’ll probably be seeing a lot more of her in the next month
                    whilst
                    the others lock themselves in their rooms revising. I’m not sure if Summer is still living here
                    as
                    I’ve barely seen her this entire calendar year.

                    My half an hour sessions with my supervisor are getting progressively shorter each week. My
                    tasks
                    for the forthcoming week are the same as they were previously: continue the report, refactor
                    code,
                    complete minor bug fixes. It’s not going to be a work intensive Easter break but that doesn’t
                    mean I
                    have the luxury of procrastinating for three weeks. I’ve set an arbitrary deadline for this
                    Sunday
                    in order to put a halt to programming my website; otherwise, I’ll be programming it forever.
                    It’s
                    like fashion - it never ends. My supervisor and I have come to a conclusion that what I’ve done
                    is
                    sufficient therefore it’s time to focus predominantly on the report and testing. They won’t be
                    difficult - just boring.

                    I’ve received feedback from an editor's position at a publishing firm. Because we now live in
                    the
                    world of AI, we get comprehensive feedback on our answers and recommendations on areas we can
                    improve. This wasn’t a technical position, meaning I would be starting at the bottom of the
                    hierarchical ladder. Not that I would mind that. What I find tedious is being offered an AI
                    response
                    and expected to be grateful for it. AI is now a tool to circumvent human interaction.
                    Ironically,
                    the position I was applying for could be completed by an AI algorithm, so it looks like the
                    company
                    has invested AI in the wrong areas. The feedback was promising however my application was still
                    unsuccessful. My attention to detail and spelling and grammar were immaculate which I am
                    thrilled
                    about given I have no academic experience in English Language or Literature. My downfall was my
                    enthusiasm for the position. Apparently, this AI algorithm could read my facial expression and
                    wasn't overly positive about the faces I pulled when talking about the company. The world has
                    gone
                    insane. Admittedly, it is probably correct, however, the company itself doesn’t have a large
                    social
                    media presence and its website looks very 2010s (if that’s any sort of vindication). Therefore,
                    my
                    due diligence could only take me so far. Anyway, onto the next…

                    Today has been different. No spiralling, no wallowing - just focus. I made a conscious effort to
                    put
                    the negativity aside and keep myself occupied. And it worked.
                    <br><br>
                    I started the morning with a run, something I’ve neglected for a while. It wasn’t anything
                    impressive, but it felt good to move, to breathe fresh air. Meditation followed - just ten
                    minutes,
                    nothing groundbreaking, but enough to reset my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    Even though it’s Saturday, I spent the rest of the day working on assignments for Advanced Web
                    Development. With as much free time as I have, I’m not handcuffed to normal working hours. I
                    think
                    I’d actually prefer it if I was.
                    <br><br>
                    I also finished Orson Welles’ biography and immediately picked up a new book. Despite his
                    legendary
                    reputation, he only made twelve films - paltry numbers compared to Spielberg and Scorsese.
                    (That's
                    films he's written, produced & starred in). It seemed like most of his life was spent trying to
                    secure funding for his Shakespeare films, which is why he appeared in so many mediocre
                    productions
                    in the ’60s and ’70s.
                    <br><br>
                    By the late ’70s, like many Hollywood icons, he started receiving honorary awards and lifetime
                    achievement recognition. France, the US, the UK, Italy, Spain - he was beloved everywhere. Yet
                    when
                    he tried to cash in on his reputation to complete his films, the money never appeared. Everyone
                    wanted to meet the genius of Orson Welles, but no one wanted to risk investing in him.
                    <br><br>
                    The book ended with a funny anecdote - Steven Spielberg purchased the <em>Rosebud</em> sleigh
                    from
                    <em>Citizen Kane</em> for £50,000. When asked about it, Welles claimed it was a fake.

                <h2>Friday, 28th March</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s always a depressing day following a sojourn to London, the reality of returning to my life
                    in
                    Leicester settling in like a dull ache. A taste of the promised land is intoxicating, yet
                    suffocating when I have to leave. I am almost within spitting distance of the capital, applying
                    for
                    every job under the sun - so long as its HQ is in London.
                    <br><br>
                    After a day of exploring or experiencing the grandiose of the theatre, I’m ebullient and
                    gleeful,
                    positively enthusiastic about the possibility of living in the capital. The shows, the culture,
                    the
                    landmarks. Ironically, a city teeming with people - more populated than anywhere else in the UK
                    -is
                    where I think I’d feel most confident.
                    <br><br>
                    I wake up still reeling from the high of the day before. The high before the comedown. More
                    confident than ever, like an adrenaline rush I don’t want to subside. I feel omnipotent,
                    completely
                    and utterly in control. But as the day continues, I feel the felicity drain from me, leaving
                    only a
                    void. It’s like waking from a dream so vivid, so tangible, only to realise it was never real.
                    Reality reasserts itself. My old self creeps back in. Emetophobia ruining my life.
                    <br><br>
                    The euphoria is deceptive. It masks the fear that always lingers beneath the surface, waiting to
                    take hold. I got close to facing my interminable fear today. I was low. I thought about sticking
                    my
                    fingers down my throat. Once it’s over, I’ll be free. At least, I hope I will be. If not now,
                    then
                    how many more years will this plague me? Like always, I capitulated under fear. Instead of
                    facing
                    the demons, I teetered on the edge - overeating, flirting with the idea. If it happens, so be
                    it.
                    But I’ve had years of practice preventing this very thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Normal people don’t feel nauseous after a large meal. They don’t hesitate before trying new or
                    exotic tastes. This is my own mind betraying me.
                    <br><br>
                    All the achievements I’ve accomplished, the prodigious steps I’ve overcome since 2018 - I would
                    hardly recognise myself in retrospect. And yet, a dark cloud still pollutes my vision. One
                    adversity, still pulling the strings. I know this fear is exacerbated by my own mind - a coping
                    mechanism, a misguided form of protection. No one thing should have this much influence over me.
                    The
                    decisions I make, the things I do. And yet, here I am. No different from the boy who feared the
                    dark
                    when I was six.
                    <br><br>
                    Only now, the fears have evolved, shapeshifted into something more insidious. Less tangible than
                    shadows on the wall, but just as consuming. The boy who feared the dark now fears himself - his
                    own
                    thoughts, his own body, his own reactions.
                    <br><br>
                    I tell myself I am stronger now, that I have conquered so much already. But strength feels
                    meaningless when I am still shackled by something invisible, something irrational. I know this
                    fear
                    is not real, at least not in the way my mind tells me it is. And yet, every time it rears its
                    head,
                    I shrink.
                    <br><br>
                    London feels like an antidote, but only temporarily. A distraction rather than a cure. I chase
                    the
                    feeling of belonging, of exhilaration, but it is fleeting. Like sand slipping through my
                    fingers, it
                    never stays long enough. The city offers a glimpse of the life I want, the person I could be -
                    confident, fearless, alive.
                    <br><br>
                    But Leicester is my reality. The place where the high fades. The place where I am left alone
                    with my
                    thoughts, my fears, my relentless mind - my own purgatory.

                <h2>Thursday, 27th March</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s a reason <em>Les Mis</em> is the longest-running musical in the West End. Few
                    productions
                    can match its scale, its depth, or its sheer theatrical brilliance.
                    <br><br>
                    For starters, this isn’t some stripped-down, minimalist affair - it’s a fully realised
                    spectacle. A
                    vast ensemble cast, multiple intricately designed sets, and seamless transitions between scenes
                    ensure that no actor has to juggle multiple roles. The story is just as comprehensive as Victor
                    Hugo’s novel, and despite its three-hour runtime, the performance flew by in what felt like an
                    instant. Jean Valjean was magnificent, commanding every scene he was in with a presence that
                    made it
                    impossible to look away.
                    <br><br>
                    This wasn’t just a carbon copy of the 2012 film either - or rather, it would be more accurate to
                    say
                    that the film itself is merely an adaptation of the stage production, which came first. The
                    sheer
                    elaborateness of the staging was staggering: Parisian streets, grand aristocratic tenements, the
                    raucous inn, and, of course, the barricades. Without resorting to overt gore, the production
                    used
                    clever lighting techniques to lend verisimilitude to the battle’s carnage - each death felt
                    impactful without overwhelming the spectacle with gratuitous bloodshed.
                    <br><br>
                    Inspector Javert was portrayed with a chilling aloofness, his relentless pursuit of Valjean
                    driven
                    not by moral ambiguity (as hinted at in the film) but by an unwavering, almost robotic adherence
                    to
                    duty. His death, a moment of tragic resignation rather than tortured conflict, was executed
                    brilliantly. Through the use of a concealed harness and a projected backdrop of the bridge,
                    Javert
                    seemed to vanish into the abyss - a simple yet strikingly effective illusion.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s rare for me to exit a performance without identifying at least one minor flaw, no matter
                    how
                    trivial. <em>Les Mis</em>, however, is as close to perfection as a production can get without
                    sounding facile. It unequivocally ranks at the very top of my musical reviews.
                    <br><br>
                    After a rapid journey to London Bridge and a quick bite with Matthew, <em>Richard II</em>
                    awaited.
                    <br><br>
                    I am normally quite meticulous when it comes to booking theatre tickets, but this time, my usual
                    diligence was overridden by two things: the allure of a £23 ticket and the presence of Jonathan
                    Bailey. What I failed to consider was the venue. A two-hour-forty-minute play wouldn’t have
                    posed an
                    issue had it been in the West End. London Bridge, however - with its limited tube lines and
                    reduced
                    late-night services - meant that leaving before the final act was inevitable. A tragic twist
                    befitting a Shakespearean history.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Richard II</em> marked my first foray into Shakespeare’s Histories - a departure from my
                    usual
                    preference for comedies, but exceptions can be made for the likes of Jonathan Bailey. The Bridge
                    Theatre features a square layout, so I optimistically assumed that even the cheapest seats would
                    provide a decent view. And yet, you can see my view below.
                    <br><br>
                    Not exactly what I envisioned. Thankfully, the production itself didn’t disappoint. By the
                    second
                    half, Matthew and I had upgraded ourselves to seats with a front-row view of the unfolding
                    drama.
                    From there, I watched Henry IV’s rise to power and Richard’s imprisonment.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground<br>
                        And tell sad stories of the death of kings."</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, time was against me. As <em>Richard II</em> prepared for his inevitable demise, I
                    had
                    my own race against fate. His final soliloquy -
                    <br><br>
                    <em>"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;<br>
                        For now hath time made me his numbering clock."</em>
                    <br><br>
                    - felt particularly ironic as I hurriedly fled towards the tube.
                    <br><br>
                    I had planned for a stealthy exit, slipping out unnoticed like a shadow in the night, leaving
                    the
                    ambiance untarnished - like a mouse: seen but not heard. But my hastily improvised escape plan
                    from
                    our appropriated seats did not go smoothly. First, I disrupted an entire row of theatre-goers,
                    forcing them to shuffle awkwardly in their seats. Then, I kicked a plastic cup, drawing
                    attention to
                    myself at the worst possible moment. The people at the end of the row, rather than standing,
                    feigned
                    helpfulness by merely twisting their legs to the side - a futile effort, given the cramped
                    walkways.
                    Although accidental, I don’t regret stepping on them in my frantic departure. By the time I
                    reached
                    the exit, I half-expected a conveniently placed rake to appear and smack me in the face,
                    completing
                    my cartoonish getaway.
                    <br><br>
                    After a panicked sprint and a determined pace, I reached St Pancras just in time. My reward?
                    Complimentary sandwiches -<em> it seems EMR is upping its customer service game.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Though I’m bitterly disappointed to have missed the conclusion of arguably Shakespeare’s most
                    venerated historical play, I at least know how it ends - <em>I have read the script, after
                    all.</em>
                    Tomorrow’s mission? To track down a grainy, illicit recording, filmed from the depths of the
                    theatre
                    by a kindred spirit who has a penchant for breaking the rules.

                <h2>Tuesday, 25th March</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mousetrap. Eight characters. One murder. Six suspects. A classic whodunit wrapped in
                    deception,
                    red herrings, and the unmistakable charm of Agatha Christie.
                    <br><br>
                    For over 70 years, this play has kept audiences on edge, its plot so tightly wound that even
                    seasoned mystery buffs struggle to predict the twists. And now, after finally seeing it for
                    myself,
                    I understand why it’s the longest-running play in history.
                    <br><br>
                    From the moment the curtain lifted, the tension was palpable. The isolated guesthouse, the
                    blizzard
                    raging outside, the radio announcement of a recent murder - every element meticulously placed to
                    pull you deeper into the web of suspicion. Every character had a secret. Every interaction was
                    laced
                    with double meanings. And yet, even with all my <em>Sherlockian</em> deductions, the final
                    revelation still caught me off guard.
                    <br><br>
                    But here’s the thing about <em>The Mousetrap:</em> it’s not just a play; it’s a pact. A silent
                    agreement between cast and audience. If you know, you know. And if you don’t - well, I certainly
                    won’t be the one to ruin it for you.
                    <br><br>
                    So, who’s the murderer? Who makes the fatal confession?
                    <br><br>
                    I’ll never tell. Consider me an accomplice now.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto a production I can actually gush about - <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>, starring none
                    other
                    than Tom Hiddleston and Hayley Atwell. One of my absolute favorite Shakespearean comedies, and
                    this
                    adaptation did not disappoint.
                    <br><br>
                    I know the play well, both from reading and watching various adaptations over the years. But
                    what
                    made this one stand out was the bold directorial choices. Jamie Lloyd, the director, wasn’t
                    afraid
                    to shake things up. He played with the structure, shifting the order of certain scenes -
                    reminiscent
                    of Spielberg moving <em>Cool</em> before <em>The Rumble</em> in <em>West Side Story.</em> It
                    didn’t
                    change the essence of the play, but it did give it a different rhythm, a fresh energy.
                    <br><br>
                    The production leaned heavily into a party aesthetic - vibrant, chaotic, and full of life,
                    making it
                    arguably one of the most fun versions I’ve seen. The chemistry between Hiddleston and Atwell was
                    electric, their banter sharp, their wit perfectly timed. Every scene between Benedick and
                    Beatrice
                    felt like a masterclass in comedic delivery.
                    <br><br>
                    That being said, I do have one critique. Theatre Royal Drury Lane boasts one of the largest
                    stages
                    in the West End, yet this production chose to forgo scenery, props, or any real set design. A
                    minimalist approach, yes, but it felt like a missed opportunity. <em>Sigourney Weaver’s The
                    Tempest</em> at the same venue took full advantage of the square footage, transforming the stage
                    into a shipwrecked island with towering mountains. By contrast, <em>Much Ado</em> felt... a
                    little
                    empty.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, even with that gripe, this production ranks solidly in my top three plays. And the cherry
                    on
                    top? <em>A £25 seat in the Royal Circle </em>- an absolute steal for a show of this caliber. I
                    can’t
                    wait to casually drop this into conversation the next time I’m boasting in an English Lit
                    seminar.

                <h2>Monday, 24th March</h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing the tale of Orson Welles terrifying America with his dramatic reading of <em>War
                    of
                    the Worlds</em>, I initially dismissed it with a familiar thought: <em>typical gullible
                    Americans -
                    so credulous, so frivolous in their vices.</em> But, in the interest of fairness, I decided to
                    actually listen to the broadcast.
                    <br><br>
                    It was so convincing that, for a fleeting moment, I considered barricading my own door. The
                    exceptional adaptation only reinforced how precociously talented Welles was. This was 1938 -
                    three
                    years before <em>Citizen Kane</em> - and this broadcast cemented his reputation, elevating him
                    from
                    a successful radio producer to a formidable cinematic force.
                    <br><br>
                    The broadcast's realism stemmed from a clever adaptation: rather than a third-person narration,
                    Welles restructured the story as a live news bulletin. When the Martians attacked, the field
                    reporter’s transmission abruptly cut out, making it sound as if he had just been incinerated by
                    a
                    heat ray.
                    <br><br>
                    Although the show began with a standard disclaimer - <em>"This is a Mercury Theatre production
                    of
                    War of the Worlds"</em> - it wasn't repeated until forty minutes in. Presumably, that was around
                    the
                    time panicked police officers started hammering on the studio doors.
                    <br><br>
                    Regret it or not, Welles’ mischievous masterpiece was the making of him. Had it not been for
                    this
                    accidental hysteria, RKO might never have handed him a three-picture deal, and the course of
                    cinema
                    history could have looked very different.

                    <em>Mickey 17</em> is a fantastic film - Natalia, Mehmet, Emily, Octavia, and Josie all agreed.
                    Unique in every aspect.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s impossible to ignore how Mark Ruffalo’s character channels Trumpian mannerisms - the
                    elongated
                    pauses, the exaggerated New York twang, the self-aggrandising cadence. Whether deliberate or
                    not,
                    the resemblance is uncanny. While the film itself isn’t political, the parallels to modern U.S.
                    politics are hard to overlook.
                    <br><br>
                    That said, did it live up to the hype? Not quite.
                    <br><br>
                    The overwhelming buzz surrounding the film felt excessive. Being Bong Joon-ho’s first screenplay
                    since Parasite, expectations were naturally sky-high. The A-list cast, the glowing reviews of
                    the
                    novel, and the prestige of Bong’s name all contributed to the razzmatazz. And while the film was
                    enjoyable, something felt missing.
                    <br><br>
                    The ending was clever. The pacing was solid. Yet at two-and-a-half hours long, I couldn’t shake
                    the
                    feeling that not much actually happened.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the many assignments in my Creative Writing course in Stockholm was to distinguish
                    between a
                    character-driven and a story-driven plot. At the time, I struggled to put it into words. But
                    <em>Mickey
                        17</em>? It’s a perfect paragon of a character-driven narrative - where the story unfolds
                    not
                    through grand events, but through the internal journey of its protagonist.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps that’s why it left me wanting more.

                <h2>Friday, 21st March</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s been six weeks since I started Advanced Web Development and my FYP. Under the normal block
                    teaching structure, other modules are reaching their denouement, so the library is packed, and
                    students are entering the familiar cycle of late-night revision and sleep-deprived study
                    sessions.
                    Some manage their time effectively. Others need help staying awake.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s where the little white pills come in.
                    <br><br>
                    I assumed this kind of issue was mostly confined to Ivy League and Russell Group universities,
                    where
                    the cost of failure is truly detrimental. Evidently, this drug epidemic has now proliferated to
                    Leicester. I can’t vouch for the veracity of the claims, but, like any university, rumors spread
                    fast.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the first time final-year students have been expected to complete their projects and
                    modules
                    in just six weeks - a timeframe far too short for the prodigious scale of these projects. For
                    context, under the previous schedule, students had 24 weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    I started two months before the deadline, so I’m unaffected, but had I begun on the official
                    project
                    declaration date, I’d probably be in the same position as my peers.
                    <br><br>
                    DMU’s 2030 teaching plan is nothing more than an advertising gimmick, something they can
                    brandish to
                    prospective students and parents. They’ve been implementing this new block teaching timetable
                    incrementally, and this year marks the first time every course and year group has been forced
                    into
                    this ‘new and improved’ pedagogical strategy.
                    <br><br>
                    I wonder if the chancellors and department heads will reconsider their approach now that a drug
                    epidemic seems to be a corollary of this new system.
                    <br><br>
                    DMU’s official response? A university-wide email outlining the risks of these ‘uppers’, along
                    with
                    the slogan: “Attaining your degree is not worth your life.”
                    <br><br>
                    Whoever came up with that line probably thought it sounded profound in the meeting room. On
                    paper,
                    it feels disingenuous.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, it’ll be interesting to see how this unfolds. Either the issue will fizzle out naturally,
                    or
                    someone will overdose - which will force the university to take more drastic measures.

                <p>
                    Now, over the past six months, I have become accustomed to having roommates. Sharing a lounge
                    and a
                    kitchen. Living with strangers has been, if nothing else, character-building. We’ve finally
                    moved
                    past the phase of hesitant nods and one-word greetings, edging into something resembling
                    camaraderie. Since Mervin - the infamous cutlery thief - moved out at the end of last year, I’ve
                    found myself the de facto man of the house.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t want to lean into gender stereotypes, but this morning’s events served as a stark
                    reminder
                    of why having a man around can, at times, be useful.
                    <br><br>
                    I got rudely woken up at around eight because Esther's incessantly banging on my door.
                    Half-conscious, I cracked it open, my bleary eyes wincing against the fluorescent glare of the
                    corridor. There stood Esther, panic-stricken and barely coherent. Through the frantic
                    gesticulations
                    and near-hysterics, I caught a single, unmistakable word: <em>mouse</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Still half-asleep, I grabbed a shirt and followed her to the kitchen, fully expecting the
                    intruder
                    to have scurried off by now. Only days ago, after Sunday’s babysitting session (as I’ve come to
                    call
                    my reassurances about the rodent problem), I confidently told the girls that the poison would
                    take
                    care of things. That the mouse would definitely not be back. This morning’s visitor had
                    spectacularly undermined my credibility.
                    <br><br>
                    Swaggering into the kitchen, ready to play the hero, I was abruptly stopped in my tracks. No
                    wonder
                    Esther had panicked.
                    <br><br>
                    There, in the centre of the kitchen floor, lay a very dead mouse. Six inches long, motionless on
                    its
                    back, feet frozen in dramatic rigor mortis. It hadn’t chosen some discreet corner beneath the
                    fridge
                    or nestled between cupboards, where we could be alerted to its demise by the gradual, putrid
                    stench
                    of decay. No. It had gone full Shakespearean tragedy - emerging from its hiding place in the
                    dead of
                    night, summoning every last ounce of strength to make its way into open territory before
                    succumbing
                    to its fate. A final act of theatrical histrionics, limbs outstretched in perfect verisimilitude
                    -
                    all four paws skyward, the universal symbol of rodent expiration.
                    <br><br>
                    I glanced at Esther, who was now performing what can only be described as an Irish jig in the
                    doorway.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s dead,” I announced, more for my own reassurance than hers.
                    <br><br>
                    She was not interested in my expert medical opinion. What she wanted was a coroner.
                    <br><br>
                    I briefly suggested waking Ash to deal with it, but we both agreed it was too early to stomach
                    the
                    sight of her skinning a rodent for breakfast. Bloody savage.
                    <br><br>
                    So, I did what any rational person would do - I gave Jerry a cautious nudge with my toe to
                    ensure he
                    wasn’t merely <em>playing</em> dead. Satisfied that he wasn’t faking it, I crouched down to pick
                    him
                    up.
                    <br><br>
                    And promptly lost my nerve.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d like to say I bravely scooped him up bare-handed, but let’s be honest - I’m squeamish. My
                    dad
                    could tell you all about the <em>Pigeon Incident...</em> a story for another day. Instead, I
                    employed the plastic bag method, shuffling Jerry inside like an evidence technician at a crime
                    scene
                    before unceremoniously lobbing him into the bin.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, if this were a film or a sappy TV show, this would be the moment when the damsel throws
                    herself
                    into my arms. <em>Oh, Harry, you’re so brave! How can I ever repay you? </em>Cue music, fade to
                    black, happily ever after.
                    <br><br>
                    Real life is less generous.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead, Esther eyed me suspiciously and demanded I take the bin out immediately - despite the
                    fact
                    that I was still in my boxers. We settled on a compromise. I remained in the kitchen, <em>armed
                    with
                    a fish slice,</em> standing guard in case Jerry decided to rise from the dead while she made her
                    breakfast. As a token of gratitude, she cooked my eggs too.
                    <br><br>
                    It seems like the go-to currency for benevolence is a free meal. First a lasagne, now eggs. No
                    complaints here.
                    <br><br>
                    Over breakfast, I reassured her that the ordeal was over, that she could once again use the
                    kitchen
                    without needing a designated rodent lookout. What I did not mention, however, was the other
                    mouse I
                    saw scuttling across the floor while she was washing up…

                <p>
                    Wednesdays. Already my busiest day, with all my lectures and labs conveniently crammed together.
                    And
                    this evening? A Traitors-themed games night at Natalia and Emily’s flat.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve never seen <em>The Traitors.</em> I watched the first episode yesterday, and - predictably
                    - it
                    was exactly the kind of reality TV drivel that makes my skin crawl. Thankfully, the game itself
                    wasn’t nearly as extravagant as the show. However, since it was Emily’s crowd - a group of
                    theatre
                    and drama students - everything had to be performed. They are the only group of friends I know
                    who
                    ask for everyone’s pronouns the moment they walk through the door.
                    <br><br>
                    The evening was surprisingly enjoyable, and I even made it to the end without a single facetious
                    remark or accidental insult. This was mostly thanks to Natalia, who spent the night stamping on
                    my
                    toes whenever I spotted an opening for a quip.
                    <br><br>
                    Natalia shares my sense of humor, but after a year of living with Emily and Octavia, she’s been
                    successfully proselytised - trained to be sensitive, receptive, and ever so slightly
                    indoctrinated.

                    My conversation with Matthew:

                    That’s it. That’s what I love about Matthew. If he’s available he’ll always say yes. No

                    This evening I had the last catchup session for the Paris trip commencing in a few weeks. From
                    the
                    twenty people who have signed up, five have had trouble acquiring a visa for the trip leading to
                    doubts whether they will be able to attend and another three have had second thoughts as they
                    underestimated their workloads as final year students. Meanwhile, I’m stress free and already
                    planning my itinerary and my mysterious illness that I’m planning to get on day three to get out
                    of
                    the pre-planned activities.

                <h2>Monday, 17th March</h2>
                <p>
                    For the past week, I’ve been doing the bare minimum, yet somehow, I can still call it productive
                    with a straight face.
                    <br><br>
                    According to the FYP brief, I need to provide diagrams and system architectural drawings to map
                    out
                    every intricate detail of my website - user flows, information processes, database connections,
                    API
                    endpoints. Riveting stuff, I know.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I designed the entire system myself, I’ve had no real difficulty completing these
                    sections.
                    It’s tedious rather than challenging. The only thing slowing me down is the visual aspect -
                    figuring
                    out how to present these diagrams in a way that looks professional.
                    <br><br>
                    I have zero prior experience in creating these types of documents, so while my drawings include
                    all
                    the necessary details, I have no idea if they align with industry standards. Every example
                    online is
                    vastly different, making it impossible to determine what <em>must</em> be included versus what’s
                    just personal style. This is exactly what my weekly tête-à-têtes with my supervisor should be
                    for.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Should be.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    From our first few meetings, I’ve gotten the distinct impression that Salimah is the type who
                    will
                    find <em>something</em> wrong with my work - not because there’s actually an issue, but because
                    she
                    <em>needs</em> to in order to justify the “challenges” section of my coursework brief.
                    <br><br>
                    Today’s meeting confirmed my suspicions.
                    <br><br>
                    Salimah was crestfallen - and not because of anything I did. Each supervisor oversees ten
                    students,
                    and apparently, over half of hers are already falling behind. Some haven’t even started the
                    coding
                    portion of their projects yet.
                    <br><br>
                    So, understandably, she was in a fractious mood.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, since I’m so far ahead, my meeting was less of an interrogation and more of a
                    show-and-tell session. She barely scrutinized my progress; instead, she just nodded along,
                    probably
                    grateful I wasn’t adding to her list of problems.
                    <br><br>
                    Another few weeks and I’ll be done. Then, finally, I can focus on my other module.

                <h2>Sunday, 16th March</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>I hate Australia.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Why does F1 feel the need to accommodate these countries? Yes, the international appeal is all
                    well
                    and good, and sure, Melbourne has traditionally hosted the first race weekend. But why - why -
                    does
                    the race need to be at 4 AM UK time? Over half the teams have their HQs in the Midlands, and
                    only
                    one team isn’t based in Europe. Keep the international circuits in the calendar, fine - but make
                    them follow UK time.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s not unheard of. Singapore and Japan both hold their races at night to cater to European
                    audiences, so why can’t Australia? The majority of the fanbase is UK/European-based, meaning
                    there’s
                    a solid argument to be made against alienating your core audience.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Rant over.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    When I finally admitted defeat and got out of bed - rather than spending another hour tossing
                    and
                    turning - I went about my morning as usual. Eggs in the pan, raiding my roommates cupboards,
                    beans
                    in the microwave - my normal routine. What I did not expect, however, was to be sharing my space
                    with a mouse.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s right. A rodent. Scurrying across the floor, officially making my university dorm
                    experience
                    <em>authentic.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Naturally, I did what any rational person would do - I put it in the group chat. In hindsight, a
                    mistake. I thought I was being courteous, keeping everyone informed. Instead, I incited panic.
                    <br><br>
                    So, I went down to reception to inquire about mouse traps - or, failing that, borrowing a
                    hammer.
                    Apparently, neither was an option. They did, however, promise to send pest control in the next
                    day
                    or two to lay poison or set traps. Great.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in the afternoon, during <em>Super Sunday,</em> I finally went to make a late lunch.
                    That’s
                    when I discovered that Esther had been waiting for me - not out of friendship, but because she
                    refused to go into the kitchen alone, lest the mouse pop out and eat her.
                    <br><br>
                    Summer also wanted it caught because she’s terrified.
                    <br><br>
                    Ash, meanwhile, is part-Indian, so she wants it caught so she can cook it. Bloody savages.
                    <br><br>
                    So instead of enjoying my football in peace, I spent my afternoon babysitting Esther while she
                    cooked - ready to scream <em>fire</em> if Jerry decided to make an appearance.
                    <br><br>
                    Turns out, I didn’t miss much. Liverpool decided to have the day off anyway to let the Geordies
                    lift
                    their first trophy in seventy years. <em>We’re never going to hear the end of this…</em>

                <h2>Saturday, 15th March</h2>
                <p>
                    Who doesn’t love an away day? The sun was shining, the train was on time, and Luton was every
                    bit as
                    old and dilapidated as one might expect. A town steeped in tradition, its architecture and
                    layout
                    harken back to a bygone era.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, there’s Kenilworth Road - a stadium with its own peculiar charm, though not in the
                    conventional sense. The away entrance? Tucked between two unassuming terraced houses, their
                    front
                    rooms long since replaced by turnstiles. Not the sleek, automated kind that most clubs have
                    embraced, but a bloke manually scanning tickets, creating a bottleneck as the away buses
                    disgorge
                    their passengers all at once. But for the ad-hoc <em>Domino’s Oak Stand</em> banner clumsily
                    bordering the doors, these houses would be indistinguishable from the rest of the street.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s becoming a tradition for me to take a lap around the ground (because I can’t find the away
                    end)
                    but that is an impossible feat at Kenilworth Road since a single alleyway separates the stadium
                    from
                    the back gardens of local residents - a thoroughfare that devolves into chaos when the final
                    whistle
                    blows, as fans attempt to navigate the crush in opposite directions.
                    <br><br>
                    Before heading inside, I explored the club shop - an unforgettable experience, if only for its
                    sheer
                    absurdity. Two shipping containers, welded together, serving as a makeshift retail space.
                    Functional? Barely. Memorable? Absolutely.
                    <br><br>
                    Climbing the steps to the stand, I was treated to a panoramic view - not of the pitch, but of
                    the
                    neighbours’ gardens. Clotheslines, patio furniture, and the odd barbecue offered a surreal
                    backdrop
                    to top-flight football. Stack these quirks together, and it's no wonder Kenilworth Road remains
                    one
                    of the league’s most sought-after away days. To put its scale into perspective, the matchday
                    attendance barely crept past ten thousand, prompting a chorus of <em>“My garden shed is bigger
                    than
                    this”</em> from the away end.
                    <br><br>
                    As for the match itself? Little to report. We didn’t win; didn’t lose. Didn’t muster a shot on
                    target. Didn’t carve out a single moment of excitement. Didn’t even spend much time in their
                    half.
                    <br><br>
                    But if we’re hunting for silver linings - no fresh injuries, a clean sheet, and, technically, a
                    shot. Off target, yes, but let’s not nitpick.
                    <br><br>
                    Mediocrity, distilled.
                    <br><br>
                    The train back to Leicester was packed with fellow Middlesbrough fans. Spotting a Teessider
                    outside
                    of their natural habitat is an easy game. The telltale signs are everywhere.
                    <br><br>
                    Physically, they’re an unfortunate breed - like bulldogs mixed with chihuahuas, incongruously
                    placed
                    among the more polished faces of the South. Put a Teessider in a lineup next to Londoners, and
                    they
                    stand out like a fish on land.
                    <br><br>
                    If you don’t see one, you might hear one. That unmistakable voice - raspy, monotone, the product
                    of
                    decades of nicotine abuse. A dialect forged in the overlap of Geordie and tough Yorkshire,
                    incomprehensible to the uninitiated.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, these are my people.
                    <br><br>
                    There’s a unique warmth in recognising one of your own. When the train crosses into northern
                    territory, I feel it - home. A deep-seated comfort, a softening of the edges. The same feeling
                    washes over me when I hear an English accent abroad, an instant tether to familiarity in a
                    foreign
                    land.
                    <br><br>
                    So, conclusions from an otherwise unremarkable day out: were it not for the airport, Luton would
                    be
                    entirely forgettable. And yet, Kenilworth Road, with all its eccentricities, remains one of the
                    most
                    coveted away trips in the league.

                <h2>Friday, 14th March</h2>
                <p>
                    I arrived at my Advanced Web Development seminar at two minutes past one. The room was empty. My
                    prediction from a few weeks ago had come true - attendance had finally dwindled to zero.
                    <br><br>
                    I stayed anyway. Finding a completely vacant classroom to work in is like stumbling upon a
                    hidden
                    gem. What puzzled me more was the professor’s response: he must have shown up on time, peeked
                    in,
                    seen an empty room, and promptly left. An interesting way to dodge a lecture.
                    <br><br>
                    Tonight, I took a break from my usual radio production shift and opted for a two-hour futsal
                    session
                    instead. Back in Stockholm, the sports hall was much bigger, but sessions were capped at fifteen
                    players. Here, the hall is smaller, yet somehow, thirty people can sign up. With no coach or
                    trainer
                    to impose order, the pre-game period descends into chaos. Balls fly in every direction, everyone
                    kicks aimlessly - it’s like leaving a group of kids alone to complete a class project.
                    <br><br>
                    When I got back to the flat, I walked straight into a crisis. All three of my roommates were in
                    full-blown panic mode. The fridge-freezer had stopped working, and everything was defrosting.
                    <br><br>
                    Maintenance doesn’t work on Friday evenings because they’re out clubbing (not speculation - Ash
                    has
                    seen them in <em>MOSH</em>), so getting help was out of the question. Esther started packing up
                    her
                    freezer drawer like she was evacuating, while Summer took a more aggressive approach - cooking
                    everything at once so she wouldn’t have to throw anything away.
                    <br><br>
                    I took a more pragmatic approach. First, I pulled the fridge away from the wall to check the
                    connection. Nothing. Next stop: the fuse box. Only maintenance has the key, but the lock is
                    flimsy -
                    something a well-placed hit with a fire extinguisher could probably take care of.
                    <br><br>

                    One of the circuit breakers had tripped. I flipped it back on, and just like that, the fridge

                <h2>Thursday, 13th March</h2>
                <p>
                    I got a message out of the blue from Francesca. It had been a while since we’d spoken - perhaps
                    my
                    fault, but I’d been busy. She said she’d let me know when the Shakespeare modules started. After
                    rewatching <em>Macbeth</em> a couple of weeks ago, I was eager for a seminar on themes, gender
                    roles, and character arcs. So, with nothing but a time and a room number, I turned up for an
                    English
                    seminar, unaware of which play we’d be discussing - or even if it would be one I’d seen.
                    Regardless,
                    I was excited.
                    <br><br>
                    Once again, I found myself at the feet of the Bard.
                    <br><br>
                    A first-year English literature seminar could easily be mistaken for a feminism rally. Computer
                    Science might be a boys’ club, but at least a few girls break in. English Lit, however, seems to
                    be
                    the opposite. I was the lone lad in a room of about forty students. Francesca and I took seats
                    at
                    the back - her with a sullen expression, me practically vibrating with excitement.
                    <br><br>
                    “This module, we will be focusing on <em>Macbeth</em>.”
                    <br><br>
                    I actually squealed. A few heads turned. Francesca stifled a laugh.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I wasn’t technically enrolled in the course, I had the luxury of enjoying the seminar
                    instead
                    of drowning in notes. I was the most vocal I’d ever been in a classroom. Unlike the dull,
                    mechanical
                    debates at Branksome, where we were forced to memorize rather than understand, today’s
                    discussion
                    was genuinely engaging. We compared Shakespeare’s original script to various adaptations,
                    dissecting
                    their recurring themes. I brought up Orson Welles’ 1936 stage portrayal of the Scottish king -
                    mostly because I’d just read about it - before steering the conversation toward more familiar
                    performances, like Ian McKellen and Judi Dench’s 1979 <em>Macbeth</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Most people had seen the 2018 Christopher Eccleston RSC adaptation, thanks to the BBC’s <em>Culture
                    in Quarantine</em> series, so we focused on that. Just to flex my theatrical snobbery, I
                    casually
                    dropped in David Tennant’s performance at the Harold Pinter Theatre. If I wasn’t mistaken, I
                    heard a
                    few envious gasps. There’s something deeply satisfying about being in a room where people get
                    the
                    significance of such a performance.
                    <br><br>
                    The two hours flew by. I was in my element. So much so that, at the end, the tutor called me
                    aside.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>I’ve been rumbled,</em> I thought.
                    <br><br>
                    English Lit must operate differently from Computer Science. I have a different lecturer for
                    every
                    module, but it quickly became clear that Literature students have the same tutor throughout the
                    year. No wonder she singled me out.
                    <br><br>
                    “I don’t recognize you. Are you new here?”
                    <br><br>
                    I confessed my sins, explaining my love for Shakespeare and listing the other classics I’d
                    devoured
                    over the years. Her tone shifted from accusatory to intrigued. Fifteen minutes later, we were
                    deep
                    in conversation about Shakespeare’s endless interpretability and the enduring impact of
                    classical
                    literature on modern audiences.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, her decree was simple: I was welcome to attend any of her seminars - provided I let
                    the
                    actual students have the first say before hijacking the discussion.

                <h2>Wednesday, 12th March</h2>
                <p>
                    Each lecture is attracting less and less people. I predict by Easter, only the people with
                    lacking
                    social calendars will attend, if only to get out of their student accommodations. Sitting in a
                    classroom watching a lecturer code can be very monotonous, especially given no real value is
                    being
                    inculcated. The only way to learn how to code is by doing, not watching.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m attending because I haven’t actually started the materials being circulated each week. Don’t
                    fret - hear my reasoning. The work pertains to the areas of web development that I have been
                    practicing for the past three months since starting my FYP. Both of my modules share many
                    similarities so although I’m behind on the lab work in Web Dev, it’s merely there to expose us
                    to
                    the type of problems that will be included in the coursework. Once said coursework is released,
                    I
                    will focus my undivided attention on that, since the majority of my FYP will be completed.
                    <br><br>
                    I arrived home after a long six hours at University to find a delectable aroma emanating from
                    the
                    kitchen. Like <em>ratatouille</em>, I followed my nose to the worktop to find the most exquisite
                    looking chicken dinner. The golden breadcrumbs, the creamy source, the perfectly roasted
                    potatoes.
                    It was divine. One might even say <em>pulchritudinous</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Normally, I wouldn’t eat someone else’s food, but since there were two dozen chicken pieces, I
                    figured the mystery chief (probably Summer) wouldn’t miss one or two pieces. So I grabbed a fork
                    and
                    took a small nugget from the side, deviously shuffling the ring of potatoes to fill the vacated
                    space.
                    <br><br>
                    As soon as I started chewing, it hit me.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Spicy. Too Spicy. Unbelievably Spicy</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Ash cooked this. <em>Definitely.</em> It’s got to be her. Coming into my house with all of her
                    herbs
                    and her spices. Summer wouldn’t disrespect the chicken <em>chef-d'oeuvre</em> like this.
                    <br><br>
                    My throat was burning and even my lips were tingling. If I were in a cartoon, I would have steam
                    firing from my ears and I would be breathing fire - <em>proper Scooby-doo style.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    I’m jumping over to the sink with my head under the faucet. Water didn’t help so I herded for
                    the
                    milk; anything to put this conflagration out in my mouth. How do people enjoy this?
                    <br><br>
                    For the next twenty minutes, I’m sat in my room with a cold flannel on my forehead, sipping a
                    glass
                    of milk every time my throat’s about to ignite.
                    <br><br>
                    When I was watching cartoons on <em>Boomerang</em> growing up, I always thought no one would be
                    foolish enough to take the cake so blatantly left on the counter - the clear setup for an evil
                    trap.
                    Turns out I’m just as gullible as <em>Hansel and Gretel,</em> lured in by an irresistible feast,
                    only to fall straight into a fiery, spice-laden snare. If Ash were a witch, I’d already be
                    roasting
                    in the oven.

                    I don’t know who snitched but my money’s on Sam or Andy. I will deal with them
                    <em>accordingly.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    After our escapades on Thursday night, Dilan’s been given a written warning for his part in the
                    cyber attack on Thursday night. Ostensibly, the only reason that he’s not been expelled is
                    because
                    of the failure of the script. In my opinion, it’s because a number of lecturers have stepped
                    forward
                    to vouch for his good character and possibly, because his expulsion would bring down the
                    university’s pass grade. Since I was involved only by proximity, I escaped with impunity but the
                    phrasing the head of department used was a backhanded insult.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>‘Given that the level of technical abilities needed to achieve what this program was
                        supposed to
                        achieve is greater than that of what you possess, I’m letting you continue your studies
                        here.
                        But let me impress upon you the severity of these sorts of incidents.’</em>
                    <br><br>
                    After that vitriol, I wish I was the one who executed the program.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Prick.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Logically, he doesn’t have a leg to stand on to punish Sam, Andy or myself. We were effectively
                    the
                    equivalent of bystanders who have witnessed a bank robbery; not party to the crime in question.
                    Unless university policy includes a caveat of guilt by association, the ominous summons to the
                    head
                    of the department's office was more of a demonstration of power than a matter of actual
                    substance.

                    It’s the deadline for the contract agreements for the final year projects. I submitted mine last
                    week but the consensus among the small group of people I keep in contact with suggests that they
                    have a long day ahead of them. My contract spans around two-thousand words. It’s purpose is to
                    delineate what our projects are about; the aims, objectives, scalability elements, and expected
                    issues. It’s important because this is the brief that our projects will be measured against when
                    supervisors come to mark them. Most people choose to be conservative in their project
                    specification
                    as it’s better to underpromise and over-deliver, however, most people are encountering the same
                    issue. They don’t know how talented they are in programming a full application since none of us
                    have
                    undertaken anything like this before. The few of us who have completed a year in industry have a
                    better insight though are still in unfamiliar territory as they’ve never worked on a project
                    solo
                    before.
                    <br><br>
                    Being close to completion in my own project gave me a clear advantage as I’m not predicting -
                    just
                    reciting what I’ve done but in future tense. Salimah’s happy with my functionality and
                    explicitly
                    told me to stop coding for the foreseeable future: <em>‘Focus on the paperwork and diagrams so
                    you’re at the same point in both the documentation and programming.’</em>
                    <br><br>
                    It’s not difficult; just tedious.

                    Monday night football is a different crowd this semester. Everyone’s got a new timetable so the
                    ankle-breaking, shin-scraping, toe-stomping modus operandi from last term has ended. It’s a much
                    calmer group who accept that it’s a friendly indoor game of futsal instead of the champions
                    league
                    final. Even being receptive to decisions against them without protestation or arguments.
                    <br><br>
                    I wish I knew this before flying in with the first knee-high challenge of the game.

                    I went on my first run of 2025 this morning, and it was just as painful as expected. I was only
                    out
                    half an hour but it felt like a marathon. Now the weather’s improving, I need to make use of my
                    running trainers otherwise they’ll fall into the profligate spending category.
                    <br><br>
                    I returned to the flat with the Indian pride taking place. Ash and Mansi invited their friends
                    over
                    to watch the cricket. I don’t mind having guests, but a warning would have been the decorous
                    thing
                    to do. I blunder into the kitchen after my run with sweat on my brow and messy hair. Seven
                    people
                    just stop and stare at me like I’m an animal in the wild.
                    <br><br>
                    I was manoeuvring around them as I was sorting out my dinner. They were baking a birthday cake
                    so
                    naturally returned later on; sniffing around, trying to secure a piece. They weren’t cutting
                    into it
                    until Tuesday, much to my displeasure so I needed to be sated with licking the bowl.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up spending the afternoon in the lounge watching Super Sunday on my iPad as they were
                    watching India vs New Zealand on their laptop. I didn’t realise how little I knew about cricket.
                    I
                    played as a kid at the RA but that knowledge left me soon after.

                    Watched <em>Anora</em> this afternoon, and it was nothing like what I expected. Typically, when
                    a
                    Russian billionaire travels to America and marries an exotic dancer, the story takes a
                    predictable
                    turn - kidnappings, drugs, guns, and organised crime. It’s not a stereotype so much as a
                    well-worn
                    trope in American cinema.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Anora</em> defies those expectations. Instead of a gritty crime film, its semblance is
                    closer to
                    a comedy than an action-packed thriller.. The plot follows the son of a Russian billionaire who
                    impulsively marries a stripper, much to his family’s dismay. Chaos ensues when his father’s
                    handlers
                    step in, dragging Anora along in a frantic search to annul the marriage. A large part of the

                    Anora, with these Russian fix-it men going on a search across New York, trying to find her

                    If you decide to watch it, I highly recommend turning on subtitles; large portions of the
                    dialogue
                    are in Russian. I can see why it’s critically acclaimed and won a plethora of awards. It strikes
                    me
                    as a film for the cinephile instead of the casual viewer. Dad would fall asleep through it.

                    It’s good to be finally back in the radio studio. I’ve started producing Jamie’s show at 7pm so
                    it’s
                    a better time for me and Jamie is such an affable person. Amicable too. He’s very relaxed and
                    much
                    less intense than the likes of Lantern. We spent two hours just chilling, listening to new
                    music. A
                    nice change from having to constantly update the playlist every five minutes.

                <h2>Thursday, 6th March</h2>
                <p>
                    We messed up. Bad.
                    <br><br>
                    I say we, I mean the Hackers.
                    <br><br>
                    DMU Hackers on Thursday evenings is supposed to teach cyber security skills to anybody
                    interested or
                    build on the foundation that most students already have. This week, we were doing white hat
                    hacking.
                    For those that don’t know, white hat hacking is ethical hacking. Hacking into a system/website
                    with
                    the owners permission to try and penetrate security vulnerabilities. This helps companies
                    protect
                    against intrusion as ethical hackers will not steal or remove any valuable data as nefarious
                    hackers
                    will.
                    <br><br>
                    The session was the penultimate installment in the series. We’ve covered the five other areas of
                    white hat hacking in sessions throughout the year. This session accumulated all that knowledge
                    and
                    we were tasked with breaking into a virtual machine. (Basically, an operating system that’s not
                    connected to the DMU infrastructure.) The session went well with only a handful of
                    Cyber-security
                    students able to penetrate the system.
                    <br><br>
                    After the session, Dilan and I and a couple of others, stayed behind to see what would happen if
                    we
                    ran a few commands on the DMU servers. We weren’t executing the commands demonstrated in the
                    session
                    because we know the full extent of what they can do. Nor, we weren’t releasing worms or trojan
                    horses to gallop through the DMU files. No, we were only wanting to bind two servers together
                    and
                    extricate a loose core to run a TCP/IP signal through it. Simple enough, right?
                    <br><br>
                    Well, Dilan and Jack, the most precocious out of us, were programming a short shell script to
                    complete the commands. Fifteen minutes passed and they finally had the perl script ready. We all
                    gathered round like they were about to reinvent fire. <em>Execute.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    The screen flicked off and on a few times and we thought this was the script working.
                    Determining
                    the signal type and attaching it to a core. We would have remained ignorant but that is when the
                    horror movie began. All the screens in the lab simultaneously flicked off and on. The restart
                    instructions finished only to reveal an ominous ‘Firewall Compromised’ message. Similar to what
                    you
                    would expect when Jurassic Park gets hacked. This message flickered on every screen in big red
                    bold
                    letters with a foreboding clock ticking from thirty. <em>A self destruct probably.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    30… 29… 28… 27…
                    <br><br>
                    The lads went into panic stations. Dilian’s trying to program a reverse shell in world record
                    time
                    to reverse the commands. Jack’s profusely trying to open the kernel to stop the detonation from
                    inside the system. Andy’s opening the PC case up for some reason, probably trying to find the
                    red
                    wire to cut. I’m watching in disbelief as this mayhem is unravelling around me.
                    <br><br>
                    15… 14… 13… 12…
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve never seen Dilan panic before. Normally, he knows the answer to every scenario when it
                    comes to
                    coding. The output to every script, the inner-workings of every command. He’s got just the right
                    level of autism so that he can communicate with the machines; only now the machines were turning
                    against him. <em>Skynet was activating.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    6… 5… 4… 3…
                    <br><br>
                    I was anticipating the explosion, bracing for alarms. Andy’s curled up on the floor, Dilan’s
                    resorted to bashing the keyboard hoping to fit in an extra 2000 words a second into his typing
                    speed. Sam’s crying in the corner…
                    <br><br>
                    Snap.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything went black. No it wasn’t a power cut, or a lockdown procedure in response to a
                    suspected
                    cyber attack. Jack had panicked and had switched off all the switches connected to the master
                    breaker. We stood in darkness. Only the lights from the street illuminate the room. Sam’s
                    whimpering
                    echoing off the walls. We all froze, unsure on how to precede. Presumably, the script breached a
                    firewall and the countdown was the attack response procedure working. Dilan’s speechless for the
                    first time. Jack’s unsure of what he’s done. Andy’s about to jump out of the window to make a
                    cunning escape from justice.
                    <br><br>
                    I turn my torch light on to get a better view at the renaissance picture unfolding in front of
                    me.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“Time to call it a night I think lads. Try again next week.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    They weren’t in the mood for my humour. We headed for the door but the door wouldn’t open.
                    Clearly
                    the lads thought they were operating in a fort knox level institution where a cyber attack would
                    lock down the building, alert the SWAT team and flood the rooms with sarin gas… Evidently,
                    programmers are not good in emergency situations.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried explaining that the door needed power to register our university ids but only Dilan and
                    Jack
                    were receptive to this reasoning. Andy and Sam think they’re heading off to prison. They’re
                    physically shaking. <em>Bloody first years.</em> They ought to work a May-day bank-holiday at a
                    garden centre. That’ll toughen them up.
                    <br><br>
                    Bravely, or rather sheepishly, Jack stepped up to turn the breakers back on since he was the
                    culpable party that caused this blackout. Like the<em> Hurt Locker,</em> he took a deep breath
                    to
                    make the ten steps to the opposing wall. I’m giggling at this point, able to recognise the
                    spurious
                    solemnity of the situation. The two lads falling into a hysteria on the corner, Jack about to
                    flick
                    a switch like he’s about to activate a nuke. Dilan’s giving me a stern look as if to say <em>‘not
                    the time Harry.’</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Jack flicked the switch and the lights flickered as they regained full brightness. The computers
                    remained off, much to our relief as we wondered if the system would reboot back to normal when
                    the
                    computers were restarted. Of course we didn’t stop to test this hypothesis as Sam and Andy were
                    bolting towards the door as soon as Dilan had it open.
                    <br><br>
                    Strangely, the lads weren’t in the mood to join the others at the pub. True to his idiosyncratic
                    nature, Dilan wanted to go home to recheck the script to see where it went wrong. Probably to
                    test
                    version 2.0 next week. Jack has a job three days a week working for the Cyber-security
                    department at
                    Next. (They kept him on after his year in industry). It is fascinating how he’s a cyber-security
                    analyst and his first instinct was to pull the plugs out of the wall… I imagine the second on
                    his
                    list was to hit the computer with a hammer. Third, to swear at it. <em>This is what happens when
                    you
                    use AI to get through your degree…</em> Sam left, presumably, to breathe into a paper bag. So I
                    headed to the Soar point alone to meet up with Mehmet to catch the end of the Fenerbahce game.
                    <br><br>
                    Another eventful evening with the DMU Hacking society…

                    I collapsed walking through campus today.
                    <br><br>
                    Within seconds, a swarm of people - teachers, student reps, even a firefighter - rushed to my
                    rescue. They probably thought I was having a seizure. In reality? I played football for the
                    first
                    time in over a month yesterday, and my foot decided to cramp up in the most excruciating way
                    possible. Similar levels to catching my beard in my coat zip. Oo it was painful. Oh and I made
                    myself look like a tit in front of hundreds of uni students.
                    <br><br>
                    Easily my most embarrassing moment since walking face-first into a glass door on my second day

                <p>
                    The weekly meetings with my supervisor are more productive than I initially thought. Because of
                    the
                    progress I’ve already made (technically before the project start date), I was under the fallacy
                    that
                    I would have to lie about where I was in my project timeline. Instead, Salimah has been very
                    understanding and accommodating. Instead of falsifying my progress gantt chart and displaying a
                    version of my website from two months ago, Salimah isn’t going to penalise me for being
                    proactive so
                    we’ve had a honest conversation about where I’m at and what I need to do. It’s been made clear
                    that
                    a working application with few features is better than a complex website with dead links and
                    faulty
                    code. Thankfully, I’ve got many features that are all functional.
                    <br><br>
                    Describing my website, Salimah has informally said that it could be graded as a first based on
                    its
                    level of complexity - as long as I can produce the pertinent documentation for all the code. No
                    one
                    likes writing documentation. It’s very anodyne even for me. I can’t use any embellished language
                    or
                    meretricious words. It has to be dry and simple which is easy … for dry and simple people.

                <h2>Saturday, 1st March</h2>
                <p>Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth. Who dares say his name?<br>
                    To laugh at luck, to dance with death.<br>
                    Who braves the dark, the cursed, the cold?<br>
                    Who writes his fate in flames and gold.
                    <br><br>
                    Blade raised high, a crimson cry,<br>
                    A cut, a thrust, a breath, goodbye.<br>
                    He who dares, he flares, he flies,<br>
                    He bleeds, he seethes, he shouts, he dies.
                    <br><br>
                    Is there a more poignant story than Macbeth? Macbeth with his blooded hands, obsequious to the
                    echoes of the witches. His brazen wife, the lady of the house, fulfilled the deed, sharing the
                    knife, privy to her husband's guilt. Macduff seething with vengeance - husband to a murdered
                    wife
                    and father to a murdered child. <em>Are you not entertained?</em> Seeking retribution for
                    Macbeth’s
                    regicide. And then there’s Banquo, the ever loyal friend, a tragedy of the witches foil. A
                    deceased
                    mind, a pawn sacrificed for no greater reason than the mistaken prophecy whispered in Macbeth’s
                    ear.
                    Haunting his killer as a ethereal spirit, toying with the perturbation of Macbeth’s paranoia.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the archetype of every revenge tragedy. The blueprint of unravelling guilt. The tales of
                    woe
                    from 400 years ago are still prevalent in today’s literature. <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley, Eyes
                        Wide
                        Shut, Black Swan.</em> The spiralling adventures of a deluded mind. We always feature the
                    protagonist and never the victims. The characters lose their sanity because of their fervent
                    love.
                    Only, these tales deserved to be explored just as the mind of Macbeth himself deserves to be
                    dissected—not just as a villain, but as a man undone by his own ambition. These stories do not
                    simply tell of madness; they unravel the intricate threads that bind love, power, and guilt into
                    an
                    inescapable fate.
                    <br><br>
                    The victims, too, are lost in the shadows of the protagonist’s descent. Lady Macduff, silenced
                    before she could voice her fear. Banquo, a man loyal to his friend but condemned by his
                    prophecy.
                    Even Lady Macbeth, the architect of her husband’s rise, is cast aside by the very ambition she
                    helped unleash.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, time and again, we return to the ones who fall rather than the ones who suffer. Tom
                    Ripley’s
                    hunger for identity eclipses the lives he erases. Nina Sayers’ pursuit of perfection is watched
                    in
                    awe, even as it costs her everything. The unnamed second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca is swallowed
                    by
                    the legacy of a woman she never knew.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps we favor these tales because guilt is more enthralling than grief. Madness is more
                    compelling than mourning. The disintegration of the mind, with all its grotesque beauty, is
                    something we can’t look away from. And so, we tell these stories again and again, giving them
                    new
                    faces, new settings, but always the same ghosts.

                    Change ups at the Demon magazine. There’s been a dispute among the upper echelons of management.
                    Bronze Sparks, (the name she identifies to) and Evan are dropping all responsibilities apropos
                    to
                    the magazine strand of the society. If it was anyone else, I wouldn’t comment, however; Evan is
                    the
                    president of the entire society! He doesn’t just get to drop one of his major responsibilities
                    because of a dispute with the editor-in-chief.
                    <br><br>
                    The dispute in question concerned Evan’s profligate use of magazine resources. You see, how it
                    works
                    when we produce an issue, Jess pays the publishing fees and costs with her own money. This is
                    then
                    subsidised and amortised by the University. Evan and Bronze published another booklet last month
                    using Jess’ account. It was a book of short stories written between them. It wasn’t discussed
                    and
                    the stories were mediocre. Lots of details describing character and places, very quick dialogue
                    that
                    misses large parts of the conversations and an expeditious denouement; normally, <em>they got
                    married and moved in together, living happily ever after.</em> I'm not even going to mention the
                    grammatical or punctuation errors. I wonder if either of the duo has actually read a short story
                    before. I’ve got a copy of their ramblings just to laugh at but also to keep as evidence of
                    Evan’s
                    ignoble behaviour; to use if I ever get into an argument or dispute with him. This booklet is
                    exhibit A.
                    <br><br>
                    Irrespective of this, Demon Media is no longer the strong triumvirate it once was, (Demon FM,
                    Demon
                    Digital, and Demon Magazine.) <em>We’re going solo.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    So, Jess called a meeting this afternoon. Ostensibly to welcome the three new editors that have
                    joined the team after their predecessors graduated last semester, although it was mainly to
                    announce
                    the departure of Bronze and Evan.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that Bronze and Evan have chosen to
                        relinquish
                        all responsibilities concerning the writing and publishing of the Demon Magazine.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Delivered like a death notice, Jess had an overt beam on her face. Clearly, she wasn’t
                    supportive of
                    the President of Demon Media unilaterally making decisions about her magazine so she made no
                    attempt
                    to hide her opinion.
                    <br><br>
                    Now she was in full control. It has the potential to be a golden age for the Magazine under
                    Jess’
                    stewardship as long as Evan doesn’t become spiteful and cut the funding.

                <h2>Thursday, 27th February</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve officially accepted the offer for the FundingHero internship for the summer. It felt too
                    lucrative to pass and ultimately will provide me with a more accurate insight into working as a
                    software developer. The possibility of securing a full time position is considerably higher than
                    at
                    the NHS too. Now, I need to continue searching for jobs after the internship.
                    <br><br>
                    The communication, or lack of communication, from the university staff is starting to wear me
                    down.
                    I don’t expect to receive instant responses or even same-day responses. Just an acknowledgement
                    that
                    they have seen my request and will address it at a later time is all I’m asking for. The current
                    ignorance is bliss approach is unprofessional and annoying. Especially when it’s from my FYP
                    supervisor - a person that I need to have weekly meetings with in order to pass my module.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan is in the same predicament. But Dilan is far more impatient than I am so instead of
                    sitting
                    idly, he emails every member of staff in the department to ask them to get his supervisor to
                    respond. Ironically, he’s been put on a spam register by the lecturers who don’t teach him which
                    I
                    find funny and discerning. It would explain the frequent break-down of communication.
                    <br><br>
                    I needed to attend a disciplinary hearing this afternoon because of the sexist Ricky Gervis meme
                    I
                    put in the demon magazine group chat a few weeks ago.
                    <span><em>(Check out part seven - Sicily)</em> </span>
                    The lads in the chat thought it was funny and most of the girls knew me well enough to know I
                    was
                    being facetious. <em>Except one.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    She reported me to Darren, the guy in charge of DMU society operations and member well-being.
                    I’d
                    never actually met him before today, but the adjectives I’d heard people use to describe him
                    were
                    universally glowing.
                    <br><br>
                    I strolled into his office, uncertain of what to expect from a university disciplinary. Darren
                    must’ve been in his late sixties or early seventies—white hair, circular glasses, dressed in an
                    impeccable suit and tie. He looked distinctly Italian, if I’m being honest. He carried himself
                    with
                    all the respectability and professionalism you’d expect from someone in his position. That said,
                    a
                    tattoo peeking out from his neck suggested he might’ve been a bit of a rebel in his prime.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>"Harry, Harry, Harry..."</em>
                    <br><br>
                    I found the whole situation rather amusing, truth be told. The reason I was summoned was clear,
                    but
                    Darren couldn’t look at me without fighting a grin. He’d been handed a printout of the group
                    chat
                    messages by the offended girl. I was half-expecting a lecture on sexism, campus politics, and
                    the
                    state of modern society. None of that came.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“That’s actually quite funny. Can you send it to me?”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Yes, you heard that right. Instead of a scolding, I was now in the process of sending a Ricky
                    Gervais meme to the DMU society operations and member well-being officer so he could share it
                    with
                    his mates. I imagine they’re all cut from the same cloth—weekends at the pub, a gallon of
                    Budweiser,
                    reminiscing about tattoos, and chuckling over the parade of problems students drag into his
                    office.
                    <br><br>
                    After just a ten-minute chat, it was clear Darren longed for the days of yore. The days when you
                    could smoke in a car with the kids and make inappropriate jokes without batting an eye. He’d
                    spent
                    the last hour consoling a student who’d been crying after a misidentification. Apparently,
                    Darren’s
                    attempt at comfort didn’t exactly hit the mark. So, when it came time to deal with my minor
                    indiscretion, I was a welcome visitor in his office away from gender politics.
                    <br><br>
                    The whole encounter felt less like a formal meeting with a university liaison and more like a
                    chat
                    down at the local pub. He ended by lamenting how far society had fallen, a sentiment I’m still
                    trying to wrap my head around. It’s curious, really. Based on our brief interaction, it seemed
                    like
                    Darren couldn’t care less about the pressing issues facing today’s students. Maybe he’s just
                    gathering material for a future memoir or undercover exposé.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s the type of person who’s not going to retire but <em>get retired</em> if you know what I
                    mean.

                <p>
                    I've been offered the second internship I applied for! While I had been leaning towards the NHS
                    internship, FundingHero has gone above and beyond—they’ve actually created a role specifically
                    for
                    me. Initially, I applied for the position of AI Officer, but after showcasing my Final Year
                    Project
                    (FYP) during the interview, they sought additional funding from DMU to hire another student to
                    work
                    on their website alongside me.
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s an excerpt from their offer email:
                    <br><br><em>
                    "First off, let me express how incredibly impressed I was by the calibre of applications for
                    this
                    role. Choosing the right candidate was not an easy decision."
                    <br><br>
                    "Following your demonstration of your Final Year Project, we would like to offer you a unique
                    role
                    tailored specifically to you. We are developing a directory for our website, and your experience
                    makes you the perfect candidate. This was not an area we had initially planned to cover, but
                    after
                    seeing your project, I spoke with our Chief Executive and the DMU ACE Internships team, and we
                    secured additional funding for this position."
                    <br><br>
                    "Your theoretical understanding of Artificial Intelligence was outstanding, and your project
                    itself
                    was exceptional. Your ability to design such an application makes you an ideal candidate to lead
                    the
                    development of our new directory."
                </em><br><br>
                    Ironically, this isn't the role I originally applied for—but it's exactly the role I want.
                    <br><br>
                    At first, the NHS internship seemed more appealing because I’d be managing a team and have the
                    creative freedom to build a product from scratch. But now, this offer is equally enticing.
                    FundingHero feels like a far more professional environment—it's a team of technical experts and
                    programmers, meaning I’ll be mentored by industry professionals and learning real-world
                    standards.
                    That’s a stark contrast to the NHS role, where I’d essentially be working alone to develop an
                    app
                    while reporting to a doctor with little technical expertise.
                    <br><br>
                    This decision just got a lot harder.

                <p>
                    Tonight was our first official roommate event—bowling, of course, a suggestion straight from my
                    bucket list. Naturally, I know my way around a bowling ball, thanks to Granddad’s RA training
                    session when I was 16. East Street Lanes only charges £5 per game for students, so I’m
                    considering
                    going back alone to hone my skills and become a semi-professional. Plus, it’s practically around
                    the
                    corner from me.
                    <br><br>
                    The first game was just a warm-up. Aswani and Mansi held their own but weren’t exactly striking
                    fear
                    into the competition. Esther was in a similar boat, though she lacked the confidence to play
                    without
                    the barriers. I, on the other hand, comfortably broke 140 and took the win with ease.
                    <br><br>
                    For the second game, I decided to level the playing field by imposing a handicap on myself—weak
                    hand
                    only.
                    <br><br>
                    This definitely made things more competitive. I was still in the lead for most of the game, but
                    Esther was surprisingly effective, knocking down pins left and right—sometimes after a couple of
                    bounces off the rails. I must be getting sentimental in my old age because, with only my final
                    shot
                    left, I found myself trailing Esther by two points. A comfortable position, right?
                    <br><br>
                    Well, in the spirit of camaraderie, I decided to let her have the win—purposefully gutterballing
                    my
                    last two shots. Hopefully, I wasn’t too obvious about it, though my first throw practically
                    landed
                    in the next lane. Regardless, everyone left happy, and honestly, I feel pretty good about
                    sharing
                    the victory. Plus, now there’s a chance we’ll go again—after all, Esther has a title to defend.

                    That’s it. A successful 48-hour coding sprint. No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women. No fun, no
                    sin—no wonder my eyes aren’t straight anymore.
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing but pure, relentless coding. In my race to finish my FYP by the end of next month, I’ve
                    set
                    myself the ambitious goal of completing all the programming by the end of this one—leaving March
                    for
                    the 10,000-word report. No distractions. No phone. No iPad. No cooking. Just me, my keyboard,
                    and
                    the shepherd’s pie I wisely froze in preparation for this grind.
                    <br><br>
                    This is one of those projects that feels like it might never be truly finished—every time I
                    think
                    close to finishing, either I find a bug or find myself adding yet another feature. Out of all
                    the
                    available project options, building a website is by far the easiest compared to AI training
                    models
                    or mobile app development. And because of that, I refuse to settle. It may not be the hardest,
                    but
                    it will be the most ambitious in terms of functionality and features.

                    Since the start of this final semester, my timetable has been light. Just five hours of lectures
                    and
                    workshops on Wednesdays and a one-hour seminar on Friday afternoons—all in Web Development. No
                    scheduled classes for the final year project, which is expected to be completed independently.
                    <br><br>
                    Earlier this week, I received an official attendance warning. Apparently, I didn’t attend enough
                    classes between November and January. This is specious, as I was attending my seminars—just not
                    the
                    ones I was timetabled for. So far this semester, I’ve been to every class.
                    <br><br>
                    The Friday seminar, though, barely attracts five people. This week, just three of us turned up.
                    The
                    tutor had given up. No new material. No course discussion. Just an hour of private revision. I
                    took
                    the opportunity to work on my FYP. If the university truly cared about attendance, they’d
                    implement
                    more stringent procedures—and enforce actual consequences for those who skirt the rules.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening, three Swedish lads were talking outside my window. They had just met another
                    Leicester
                    city fan on the street and they were being convivial with each other. Generally, complaining
                    about
                    football and the poor state of their team. It was the most well-mannered discussion I’d ever
                    heard
                    from fans after a 4-0 thumping. I couldn’t help but laugh about some of the comments. I was in
                    half
                    a mind to go down just to join in complaining about the Boro.

                <p>
                    Last night, we made a monumental breakthrough. Flat 101 is finally a university dorm where the
                    occupants actually talk to each other and plan social outings. Humorously, we all gathered in
                    the
                    kitchen because the fire alarm went off at 10pm last night. Very odd time for a drill. Hence why
                    we
                    all convened in the kitchen to see if it was real. Of course, we all remained in the building
                    and
                    waited till the alarm ended or we could smell smoke.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t remember what kicked it off but we ended up chatting till three this morning talking.
                    Now
                    I’m shattered but it was worth it because of the bonds created from five hours of talking. Now
                    we
                    have a bucket list of the traditional roommate activities to do before the end of the academic
                    year.

                <p>
                    Good news is, I’m on the mend. Well enough to have my initial meeting with my FYP supervisor.
                    Since
                    the project hasn’t <em>officially</em> started, I was only proposing a meet-and-greet so we
                    could
                    get to know a little bit more about our technical backgrounds. The five minute chat quickly
                    spiralled into a one hour Agile Sprint. Seeing the prodigious codebase nearing completion and
                    testing implemented too, Salimah intoned it would be a prosperous idea to take a step back and
                    start
                    the report on it now so I can write about the challenges and triumphs I’ve faced so far. There
                    are a
                    few other menial tasks I need to complete; declarations honouring the student code,
                    anti-plagiarism,
                    ect, but apart from those, I predict I can complete this module, (or at least the coding) by the
                    end
                    of next month. That is my aim anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    Following this meeting, my only day of lecturers and seminars commenced for Advanced Web
                    Development. I am so pleased about the poor communication among the leaders and the admin staff
                    in
                    the Computer Science faculty because if they had responded to my emails, I may have switched to
                    Data
                    Protection and Privacy instead. Their poor punctuality has actually saved me from making a
                    mistake.
                    <br><br>

                <h2>Tuesday, 18th February</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve had to cancel my catchup with Dilan because of my lingering cold. I don’t have any modules
                    with
                    him anymore but we’ve agreed to meet up once a week to act as outside counsel for our FYPs; to
                    critique and test each other’s work. My goal is to achieve a functional and robust site, Dilan’s
                    is
                    to create an impenetrable fortress that even the Russians wouldn’t be able to infiltrate. I
                    think
                    that best elucidates the degree of complexity that our respective projects will have.
                    <br><br>
                    Also casualties of my cold are the Paris trip meeting and Emily’s
                    ‘supercalifragilisticexpialidocious birthday game night spectacular’. The former was a
                    necessity,
                    the latter was a shame to miss. Nevertheless, the way I feel now, I don’t want to move more than
                    the
                    twenty feet it takes to get to the kitchen.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, I’ve been offered an internship over the summer at an NHS practice, coding their new
                    mobile
                    applications and implementing chatbots. The interview was last Wednesday after my first seminar
                    of
                    Advanced Web Development. It was very hastily arranged. I only confirmed my attendance the
                    previous
                    evening with Dr Shafi. I realised at the end that he had earmarked me for the position before we
                    had
                    even spoken; he even divulged that he was the one who had shortlisted me because of my
                    impressive
                    CV. The interview was supposed to be 20 minutes, an informal chat, but it quickly became
                    apparent
                    that he was including me in all of the plans for the summer because he wanted me to LEAD the
                    team,
                    so the interview spanned over an hour.
                    <br><br>
                    He did offer me the role at the conclusion of the interview, but officially it has to be
                    ratified by
                    DMU, therefore, they need to sign off on the details.
                    <br><br>
                    In the interview, I must express how euphoric I felt when I was offered the role. I could have
                    jumped up and done a little dance but thankfully, I managed to control myself. Dr Shafi
                    interviewed
                    ten students at DMU and even though I postponed because I was in Sicily, he was still eager to
                    have
                    a conversation with me.
                    <br><br>
                    So who is he? He’s a doctor in the local practice in Leicester that is part of the NHS. He was
                    the
                    one conducting the interview because he’s got an affinity for technology. As a doctor, he’s well
                    positioned to build applications that users actually need. Previous projects he’s undertaken
                    have
                    been scaled up to other practices in the midlands and some have even been deployed nationwide
                    within
                    the NHS.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s had five previous interns in past years and a few other students directly contact him about
                    undertaking these projects but none of them have a CV as sparkling as mine. The projects
                    themselves
                    range from maintaining the website, to creating an AI chatbot, to developing a Mobile
                    Application.
                    All of these things, I am familiar with.
                    <br><br>
                    Because he’s a doctor, he wants someone with the technical milieu to lead this mismatched team
                    of
                    volunteers. I’ll be getting paid from DMU because it’s a university lead internship, however the
                    others are just volunteers who want real-world experience. I can’t blame them because we’re all
                    craving for experience so we can start applying for jobs at the next rung up the ladder.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m waiting for the outcome from the other interview at FundingHero before ultimately committing
                    to
                    the role.
                    <br><br>
                    Personally, I think <em>PRODUCT TEAM LEADER at the NHS</em> will look a lot better on my CV than
                    <em>IT INTERN at FundingHero</em>. I am attracted to the latter because they are all IT
                    professionals and I will be learning in a technical environment from experts. At the NHS, I’m
                    likely
                    going to be figuring things out for myself and pawning a lot of jobs off onto my underlings
                    because
                    as the Team Leader, that is my job. Also the possibility of getting a full time position after
                    the
                    six weeks has elapsed is greater at the NHS.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Decisions, decisions.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    If possible I want to do both since they are only 18 hours a week but I'm sure DMU will have
                    some
                    arbitrary rule preventing this.

                <p>
                    So the maternal instincts are on full display in the flat. My malaise has worsened overnight so
                    I’ve
                    confined myself to my room. The only time I left was for tomato soup only to meet Aswany and
                    Esther
                    in the kitchen. Seeing the anemic state I was in, both showed empathetic concern. Despite my
                    protestations, I was ordered like a schoolboy back to my room. Thinking about it, it may just be
                    because they don’t want to catch my lurgy.
                    <br><br>
                    Regardless, Aswany brought my soup to my room and Esther made me something for my throat. I
                    don’t
                    know what it was but it was soothing whatever it was. Also on the tray was paracetamol and more
                    tissues too. They’ve clearly heard the elephant noises I’ve been making all afternoon.

                <p>
                    I’m ill. I was fine yesterday; effervescent even. Made it back to Leicester in plenty of time to
                    attend my afternoon lectures. Unfortunately, they weren’t as propitious as I would have liked
                    but
                    nevertheless, I registered my attendance.
                    <br><br>
                    Last night I was channeling my inner chef. I was having aubergine, mushrooms, leeks, onions,
                    with
                    roast potatoes and sausages. If my 19-year-old could see me now, he would be incredulous. Today
                    however, I’m back to tomato soup with bread. Very bland but necessary to ease my sore throat.
                    The
                    only problem is, now I have a fridge full of ingredients that go out of date on Tuesday so I
                    need to
                    beat this cold sharpish.
                    <br><br>
                    So what have I done? Well, from my sick bed, I’ve watched <em>The Banker</em>, <em>The
                    Magnificent
                    Ambersons</em>, & <em>The Gorge</em>. I’ve also watched three football matches and read another
                    chapter of Orson Welles’ biography. I’ve been getting a steady flow of fresh air permeating my
                    room
                    from the small aperture under my door. I would open my window but then I start shivering.

                <p>
                    First day of Advanced Web Development, and for once, a revelation—we’re actually being taught
                    through live demos instead of being crammed into a 400-seat lecture theatre, forced to endure a
                    lecturer droning on about theoretical advancements in programming languages. A breath of fresh
                    air.
                    <br><br>
                    Though, naturally, my seminar tutor kicked things off with: <em>“Continuing from where we left
                    off
                    last year.” </em>Fantastic. Apparently, the revamped Computer Science course has placed a
                    greater
                    emphasis on Web Development—an emphasis I’ve skillfully managed to sidestep by doing an Erasmus
                    year. Typical. Instead of practical, hands-on learning, I get to slog through three modules on
                    AI
                    and Machine Learning, all while the new intake actually get to <em>do</em> things. It’s like
                    missing
                    the fun part of the ride and showing up just in time for the coursework. I’ve requested access
                    to
                    last year’s module shell to catch up, though I’m fairly confident I can hold my own regardless.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I’m feeling optimistic. I’ve been developing websites for three years, and somehow, this
                    is
                    the first time I’m being formally taught how to do it in a university module. The assessment?
                    Build
                    a web app. Finally, something worthwhile. The only downside? Group work. Thankfully, we’re using
                    GitHub, so there’ll be a digital paper trail exposing any freeloaders. If I’m carrying the
                    group, at
                    least it’ll be documented.
                    <br><br>
                    Whilst I’ve been away, the March edition of Demon Magazine has been released.
                    <a href="Demon%20Magazine%20February%202024.pdf">Check it out here;</a>
                    I’ve written two articles about soporific topics like Valentines day and
                    <a href="https://www.demon-media.co.uk/2025/02/05/lgbt-representation-in-the-media/">LGBT
                        representation in Film & TV.</a> The latter was certainly more enjoyable to write so I would
                    urge you to go and read that. I managed to include a few favourite’s like <em>Doctor Who</em>
                    and
                    <em>The Children’s Hour</em> and many other films that no one else has heard of. I wrote 500
                    words
                    before I needed to refocus my article because I released it was just a homage to Russell T
                    Davies
                    shows.

                    My Boro ticket came today as well which saves me an unnecessary trip to the ticket office at
                    Bramall

                <p>
                    Back to the regularly scheduled blogs.
                    <br><br>
                    I had the best sleep of my life last night. Fell into a deep sleep as soon as my head hit the
                    pillow… at 10pm. Waking up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I felt unusually alert and ready for my
                    internship interview. Normally, the mere thought of an interview fills me with trepidation, a
                    lingering sense of apprehension. But not today. Today, I was riding an inexplicable wave of
                    satisfaction and exultation—undoubtedly the aftereffects of my recent adventures. If this was a
                    serotonin boost, it couldn’t have arrived at a better time.
                    <br><br>
                    The interview required me to present my portfolio and discuss my past projects for 30 minutes.
                    We
                    ended up filling the best part of an hour. That has to be a good sign, right? I’ll know for sure
                    next week when they give me their decision, but for now, I’m taking it as a win.
                    <br><br>
                    Today also marked the start of my final round of modules. My final year project—already well
                    underway (and practically finished)—is going to make these last four months much lighter than
                    anticipated. That leaves me with Advanced Web Development, which I’m more than comfortable with.
                    The
                    only thing that nags at me is whether my supervisor will be a stickler for the official
                    guidelines.
                    Technically, we’re only meant to dedicate 300 scheduled hours to the project, with an official
                    start
                    date of the 25th. The problem? The software I use to log my changes, timestamp every update
                    therefore making it painfully obvious that I will exceed my allotted hours long before the end
                    of
                    the module.
                    <br><br>
                    Surely, I won’t be penalised for taking initiative. Right? After my first meeting with her, I’ll
                    gauge whether she’s the lenient, encouraging type or the kind who enjoys enforcing the letter of
                    the
                    law. Worst case, I can always create a new folder, transfer my work, and “start fresh” with
                    amended
                    timestamps. But hopefully, she appreciates enthusiasm rather than punishing it.

                <p>
                    White Rabbits, white rabbits, white rabbits.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I cannot stay in bed for the week as suggested yesterday because today I’m off to
                    London. First for a catchup with Matthew and then seeing the award winning <em>Hadestown</em>.
                    Before I go
                    though, the lecturer I emailed has agreed to be my supervisor. Better still; she has also signed
                    off
                    on my idea without recommending any changes at all! Fantastic! That means in the next four
                    months, I
                    only have one module to complete instead of two because I’ve practically completed the FYP
                    already.
                    <br><br>
                    Update: Hadestown is spectacular, almost like a cult classic.. I knew very little about it but
                    for
                    the incessant posters plastered all over the underground and the flash of the neon lights as I
                    walked under the billboard on Shaftesbury avenue. It is American folk music; reminisce of <em>Wade
                    in the Water</em>or <em>The Devil of Our Time</em>. The story follows a girl, taken by Hades -
                    King
                    of the underworld - and her true love trying to find her to execute a rescue. I use the term
                    cult
                    classic because I haven’t seen an audience respond to a musical like that since the release of
                    <em>Hamilton</em>
                    in 2016. There were Italian’s either side of me and they stood applauding after every
                    showstopper.
                    My rating: solid 8.5.

                <h2>Friday, 31th January</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the deadline has been extended to next week, Dilan and I were able to meet up to critique
                    each
                    other's papers. We have very different approaches to the assignments, neither one is considered
                    the
                    de
                    facto way of doing it but they are still correct. I love a 3000 word essay as nerdy as that
                    makes
                    me.
                    After I complete the first draft with the bulk of the information, I can start editing it and
                    add my
                    personal flair. Dilan describes it as ‘a storybook layout that has a beginning, middle and end.’
                    I
                    agree
                    with this; each part building up the narrative until finally culminating in an interwoven
                    denouement.
                    That’s how I’ve learnt to write, irrespective of the medium that I’m supposed to be following.
                    Essays,
                    case reviews, research proposals, they’re all the same. Fragmented bits of information arranged
                    into
                    a
                    linear format to build a picture of the subject topic.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan’s approach is much more succinct. Written in spoken English and concise. No equivocation
                    or
                    verbose language. When I was reviewing his work, I twitched every time I saw a word out of
                    place. I
                    have
                    a whole lexicon of words that I avoid in academic papers. <em>A lot of</em> can be converted to
                    <em>a
                        plethora</em>; <em>incorrect</em> can be <em>spurious</em> or <em>erroneous</em>. They’re
                    just
                    little
                    things that make the paper more sonorous to read. I left the library satisfied with Dilan’s
                    stamp of
                    approval.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto this afternoon’s activities, a task that every student needs to complete nowadays - the
                    character
                    and behavioural tests of a job interview just so employers can check if we’re going to be a <em>satisfactory
                    addition</em> to their team. Not great or exceptional. <em>Satisfactory</em>. They were the
                    words
                    verbatim on Sage’s
                    employee portal. How about giving us coding problems to check our suitability to the job or a
                    case
                    study
                    to assess our professional proclivities in a workplace environment. No, instead they ask us to
                    complete
                    psychometric games to check our worthiness.
                    <br><br>
                    One test included hitting the spacebar as many times as I could in sixty seconds. This
                    correlated to
                    our
                    level of determination. Another asked us to see how many words we could copy from a transcript
                    within a
                    time limit - basically a typing test. This obviously correlates to gauging our attention spans.
                    I
                    imagine
                    they think all Gen Z struggle to focus on one task at a time given the dopamine overload we get
                    from
                    social media. Ironically, the transcript was the company’s own diversity and inclusion policy,
                    which
                    emphasised the importance of valuing candidates as individuals rather than reducing them to
                    arbitrary
                    metrics.
                    <br><br>
                    No questions or scenarios even remotely close to what the job specification included and yet
                    upon
                    concluding the games, I’m rewarded with a comprehensive personal profile outlining my strengths
                    and
                    shortcomings:
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“You are an exceptionally kind and empathetic individual with a high risk tolerance, making
                        you
                        a
                        supportive and bold decision-maker. However, you struggle with focus and exerting consistent
                        effort,
                        often choosing tasks based on impulse rather than necessity. While well-liked and
                        adventurous,
                        your
                        success may depend on strategies to improve concentration and follow-through.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Quite a report, especially since no verbal questions were asked.
                    <br><br>
                    Just when I thought I’d had a taxing afternoon jumping through administrative hoops, I went to
                    the
                    radio
                    studio to produce Lantern’s show. First thirty seconds in the studio, Lantern tells me she’d
                    been
                    off
                    her antidepressants this week and she’s depressed. Who’d have guessed? She said she didn’t want
                    to
                    talk
                    about it and then proceeded to talk about it for the next ten songs. I thought about pulling the
                    fire
                    alarm.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, someone was reading my thoughts - or I have the power of manifestation, because at
                    that
                    moment, the alarm blared to life on its own, offering me a perfect excuse to leave. Clearly I’m
                    not
                    as
                    empathic as my psychometric tests suggested.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, it’s eight o’clock and I’m totally shattered. It’s the end of the module and it’s half term
                    next
                    week. Therefore I’m crawling into bed and not resurfacing for at least nine days. What a life I
                    lead.

                <p>
                    The supervisor has finally emailed me back about supervising my final year project. She wants
                    more
                    details regarding the project's suitability for her. Excuse me? I thought as soon as I request a
                    supervisor, I will get that supervisor. They don’t get the option to pawn us off to the next
                    person.
                    If
                    that is the case, this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Especially since I am very
                    close to
                    the completion of my FYP, (final year project). I just need a supervisor to sign off on my idea
                    as
                    it is
                    so I don’t need to undertake radical changes to fit their project specs.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, my shaver came today so now I look less like uncle Albert and more like Charlie
                    Hunham
                    again. The moment I stepped out of my room with my tidy beard and my hair washed, I get
                    compliments
                    from Esther and Aswany. They clearly haven’t seen me look presentable in a while.
                    <br><br>
                    I have spent the past week perfecting my essays. 1000 words on ethical pitfalls of the
                    proliferation
                    of
                    AI in industrial settings and a 3000 word proposal detailing the developmental methodologies and
                    processes that should be implemented to ensure scalability, quantum bifurcation and legal
                    compliance.
                    (It’s not as daunting as it sounds, I promise). Just as I have everything perfect, every word
                    meticulously chosen and every reference checked and double checked, I go to submit and in bold
                    crimson
                    across the screen: <em>The Deadline has been extended 1 WEEK. Submission due 07/02/25.</em>
                    Ridiculous!
                    <br><br>
                    I am speculating here, but I think because of the obfuscation during the seminar last Tuesday,
                    our
                    module lead has decided to be lenient.
                    <br><br>
                    I am vexed. I’m in the small minority of people who can actually read. I understood the
                    coursework
                    after
                    I read it the first time in December. We have had ample time to query, question, protest and
                    plead
                    with
                    our seminar tutors about the assignments but the angry mob only voiced their concerns for the
                    first
                    time
                    last week. This was not a genuine plea, nor a true representation of the level of difficulty of
                    the
                    coursework. It was a deputation of students jumping on the bandwagon to ambush the module
                    leader.
                    <em>‘If
                        enough people complain, she is bound to change the course’</em> was the misguided mantra.
                    <br><br>
                    Two hundred students are undertaking the module; it was made unequivocally clear to us how
                    important
                    participation in all the seminars was and yet each seminar had a maximum of eight students
                    attending.
                    Now, it’s judgement day and the townspeople aren’t ready. I agree attendance should be mandatory
                    however, it undermines Ismini’s statement since my seminar tutor was dwelling on the wrong areas
                    for
                    the
                    first half of the module.
                    <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, the assignments were understandable despite the complaints in the forum: <em>‘the
                    grammar
                    is confusing’. ‘The questions are ambiguous’. </em>So it’s not an issue with the questions, it’s
                    an
                    issue with the wording? Personally, I am under the fervent belief that I could have completed
                    these
                    assignments back in Darlington by reading up on the subject matters myself. Regardless of my
                    personal
                    opinions, I have the coursework finished, albeit a week early. Because of that, I can actually
                    enjoy
                    my
                    week off instead of writing about workplace development strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m looking at starting the third draft of my novel. Since my FYP is practically done, I’ll have
                    considerable time to work on it. Exciting, I know.

                    skills, light tackling. Nothing egregious. However, there is one person who takes everything too
                    seriously.
                    <br><br>
                    Picking the teams, trying to implement tactics, yelling when we stray out of formation - <em>on
                    a
                    five-a-side court</em>. Unilaterally deciding who plays, who’s in goal and who’s on the bench.
                    Going
                    as
                    far as acting as the quasi referee when he’s on the sidelines. The ironic part is, he’s probably
                    the
                    worst on our team. I can only imagine what would happen to him if he tried this on a Monday
                    evening.
                    Legs broken, stretchered off probably.
                    <br><br>
                    After an hour of playing under his draconian leadership, on a solid 0-5 losing streak, the rest
                    of
                    the
                    team mutinied. After singling out our midfielder as the worst player, and publicly criticising
                    him,
                    this
                    tipped everyone over the edge. Since they all speak Arabic, I can only deduce what they were
                    saying
                    from
                    their animated body language and the passionate roars in their inflections.
                    <br><br>
                    Much to everyone’s dismay, the lone ranger didn’t capitulate; leading to two players switching
                    teams,
                    one deciding he didn’t want to play and one leaving. I was stood by Emmanual who was translating
                    what he
                    could of the shouting. We merged into two teams and guess who didn’t have a team. Not to worry,
                    he
                    decided what team he wanted to be on and ordered a bib off one of the players.
                    <br><br>
                    I was incredulous. To set your stall out the way he did and yet still miss easy chances, and
                    lose
                    the
                    ball as often as he did, I wouldn’t be so confident.
                    <br><br>
                    After another half an hour of his antics, we called time of death on our fun. I wish there was
                    an
                    allegory or poignant ending to this anecdote but there isn’t. There just isn’t. It feels like
                    it’s
                    been
                    a long day but it’s only 15:50.

                <h2>Monday, 27th January</h2>
                <p>
                    Demon Magazine February Edition is close to being released therefore I found myself in an
                    editorial
                    meeting this morrow with Jess, Molly and Amina. The brains behind the operation,
                    <em>ostensibly</em>.
                    The past editions have been permeated with spelling errors and formatting issues. Add that to
                    the
                    copyrighted images in conjunction with the articles, I’m surprised the university hasn't been
                    issued
                    a warning or a fine yet.
                    <br><br>
                    As editor-in-chief, it is under Jess’ purview to send the finished mag to the publishers. As the
                    release date is only round the corner, we thought Jess had ordered some previews when she turned
                    up
                    with a
                    package. Not quite. The creative writing team—Bronze and Evan—put together a booklet showcasing
                    their work. While their intentions may have been admirable (a portfolio for interviews,
                    perhaps?),
                    the
                    execution was lacking. The booklet’s formatting looked like it had been handled by a novice in
                    an IT
                    lesson: misaligned text, blurry images, and inconsistent margins. On top of that, the stories
                    themselves were riddled with grammar mistakes. It reminds me of the class swat wanting to
                    present
                    their
                    lacklustre work that they think is amazing. They even had the audacity to put the Demon Mag
                    emblem
                    on the cover
                    to signify the association with the University Media Group.
                    <br><br>
                    Creative writing is a difficult task, (any writing is a difficult feat), which is why I am
                    scrupulous about what I release. Everything is edited, and at the bare minimum: spellchecked.
                    Turns
                    out, these
                    two, who are dating, are less assiduous and publish everything the moment it is written.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I’m not editor-in-chief, it’s not my concern. I’m a bystander so I can sit and laugh at
                    this
                    shambolic display. Jess, less so. Since she’s the boss, everything needs to go through her in
                    order
                    to get published. She wanted to resign after seeing the finished products. Luckily she ordered
                    the
                    bare
                    minimum: 20 copies! I’ve taken one just so I have a record of the quality of writing that I am
                    lumbered with in the Demon mag.

                    I watched <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> this afternoon before the Boro game. A great film but
                    confusing.
                    Classic Stanley Kubrick. <em>“We should be grateful for our adventures, if they were real or in
                    our
                    dreams.”</em> A lot of subconscious text about reality and psychology. It’s similar to <em>Belle
                    De
                    Jour</em> and I’ve already journaled thoroughly about what a mind-bender that was.
                    <br><br>
                    My kitchen has become a lot busier this new year. Aswany has friends round some evenings and
                    they
                    have
                    some sort of agreement about sharing meals. I don’t mind this but they use a lot of spices –
                    spices
                    that
                    hurt my eyes after being exposed for the thirty seconds it takes me to put my sausages in the
                    oven.
                    I’m
                    starting to sense that it is a deterrent. When they’re not making Sarin gas in the Kitchen,
                    Esther’s
                    starting having more meals in the apartment because her friends have finished their Masters’
                    degrees
                    and
                    therefore have left Leicester, so she’s using all four hobs to create some abomination. I can’t
                    even
                    just slip in to throw some frozen food in the oven because my other roommate, Summer, is batch
                    cooking
                    brownies. Why brownies?? What made this worse is there was no offer of sharing these delights in
                    the
                    form of reparation for hindering me. No, it’s everyone for themselves. What tipped me over the
                    edge
                    and
                    led me to call a flat meeting tonight, was between the three of them, they’ve used all of my
                    milk.
                    Now I
                    don’t mind sharing but if I can’t have my Weetabix after a long day coding, there’s going to be
                    hell
                    to
                    pay. Let me tell you, those brownies suddenly made an appearance.

                <p>
                    So, my lecturer has given up. There’s a week of content left, but he’s decided to release the
                    materials
                    early so we can “read it and get it over with.” Those weren’t his exact words, but his body
                    language
                    said it all. This is his first time teaching the module, and I suspect it’ll be his last. He’s
                    ready
                    to
                    retire, and dragging himself into a seminar with fewer than five students just isn’t worth it.
                    Honestly,
                    I can’t blame him.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve been attending every class, and I think that’s why he’s grading on a curve. My first
                    assignment
                    scored a 95%, which felt overly generous given the gaps I left. If this is some kind of
                    concealed
                    favoritism—showing up in exchange for lenient grades—I’ll take it. Seems like a fair trade.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening, I spent two hours giving Lantern a history lesson in the radio studio. It’s
                    ironic—she
                    hosts a music show but doesn’t know much music beyond 2005. <em>Bloody millennials.</em>I
                    started in
                    the
                    50s
                    with Elvis, worked through The Beatles and The Who in the 60s, and climbed the decades from
                    there:
                    Elton
                    John, Queen, and Zeppelin for the 70s; U2, The Jam, and The Clash for the 80s (the golden age,
                    if
                    you
                    ask me); and Oasis, Green Day, and Red Hot Chili Peppers for the 90s. By the time we hit The
                    Ting
                    Tings
                    and The Killers, our slot was over, and Lantern was clearly ready to escape.
                    <br><br>
                    As producer, I call the shots on what goes on air. If I leave it to Lantern, it’s all Pokémon
                    theme
                    tunes and songs recycled on Glee. Not on my watch.
                    <br><br>
                    I stayed back to produce Jamie’s show and finally caught up with him after Christmas, but the
                    studio
                    soon descended into chaos. Angel barged in with eight of the refreshers crowd, all piling into
                    the
                    room,
                    leaning on my control panel, and knocking sliders out of place. A few of them are talking about
                    starting
                    podcasts, which I’ll probably end up producing. That’s the only reason I bit my tongue instead
                    of
                    telling them to pi... politely find their way out.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, Mother thought watching The Traitors was more important than catching up with her
                    youngest son that she hadn’t spoken to in almost a month. Priorities eh.

                <p>
                    Since it’s my final year in Leicester, I’ve decided to make the most of the cultural events that
                    are
                    unique to this city. First up: the Leicester Comedy Festival. To kick off the festivities, I
                    went to
                    see
                    Jason Manford on his tour at De Montfort Hall.
                    <br><br>
                    Scanning the room, I quickly realised I must have been the youngest person there by at least two
                    decades. Manford clearly draws a different crowd compared to someone like Jimmy Carr. When I saw
                    Jimmy
                    Carr with Nat and Mehmet, the audience was packed with young adults and youths doing their best
                    to
                    pretend they were adults. Tonight, though, the vibe was all beer guts and white hair. The man
                    sitting
                    next to me had a walking stick. He either struggled to hear or found some of the references too
                    modern
                    for his carefully curated lexicon. Still, I found it amusing that his wife knew what a nonce
                    was.
                    <br><br>
                    Manford’s show was a completely different experience from Jimmy Carr’s. While Carr delivers
                    rapid-fire,
                    edgy one-liners, Manford leans into anecdotes and observational humor. His set has a smooth,
                    linear
                    flow, tying everything together in a satisfying denouement. I’ve always thought of him as one of
                    those
                    comedians I’d happily watch if he was on TV, but not someone I’d go out of my way to see. That
                    said,
                    Leicester doesn’t offer a comedy buffet, so when a BBC game show host comes to De Montfort Hall,
                    you
                    take the chance. For £18, it was a steal—especially since I upgraded myself to a vacant seat
                    after
                    the
                    warm-up act wrapped up.

                <p>
                    One year ago today, I watched <em>Letter to an Unknown Woman</em> & <em>Casablanca</em> for the
                    first
                    time. My introduction to the Golden Era of Hollywood. Since then, I have watched 193 movies in
                    this
                    calendar year; 129 of those from before 1970. 57 from before 1950. 25 Warner Bros. produced; 23
                    MGM,
                    18
                    Paramount. 16 starring Cary Grant, 15 starring Bogart. 13 directed by Alfred Hitchcock. 8 with
                    Jimmy
                    Stewart, 6 with Fonda. 4 written or directed by communists, 3 films classed as propaganda
                    productions. 2
                    that made me cry and only one with Bogart not wearing a suit or a fedora.
                    <br><br>
                    To celebrate this momentous achievement, I indulged in another cinematic gem: <em>Now,
                    Voyager</em>.
                    Arguably the granddaddy of all "girl gets a makeover, gains confidence, becomes a strong
                    independent
                    woman" movies. A trope so ubiquitous today, it's hard to believe this was groundbreaking. Of
                    course,
                    any
                    film with Bette Davis, I approach with a healthy dose of skepticism, given my lingering trauma
                    from
                    <em>Whatever
                        Happened to Baby Jane?</em> I perhaps should have watched Bette Davis’ film catalogue in
                    chronological
                    order and save the horror for the end.
                    <br><br>
                    But hey, at least I learned what Victor Laszlo got up to after fleeing Casablanca. And it turns
                    out
                    Captain Renault found his true calling as a psychiatrist after the Police too. Who knew?

                    Just as I am trying to get back into the swing of things after an intense four days of
                    programming;
                    I
                    have two essays due in ten days; accumulating a 4000 word count. I have a shiver that runs down
                    my
                    spine
                    whenever I see apostrophes because they were causing us a plethora of issues over the weekend.
                    Computer
                    code uses apostrophes to differentiate text from system commands but we were using them in their
                    literal
                    sense in the context of language which beleaguered our AI models for 48 hours straight.
                    <br><br>
                    The seminar detailing the specifics of these assignments this morning was not as informative as
                    I
                    would
                    have liked. But that seems to be the common threat surrounding this module. The purpose of the
                    assignments is to think of a solution to an IT problem and justify our answers. This was clearly
                    too
                    perplexing for many students because the general consensus from the seminar was ‘this is too
                    confusing’,
                    ‘we don’t know what you want from us’, ‘it needs to be explained more thoroughly’. Personally, I
                    thought
                    it was all very dramatic.
                    <br><br>
                    Because there are no right or wrong answers so we’re getting graded on our reasoning skills,
                    everyone
                    was panicking because the solution isn’t spoon fed to us in black and white. We need to read
                    research
                    papers and articles to deduce our own conclusions. Clearly, these instructions were too
                    inscrutable
                    for
                    final year computer science students.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, maintenance installed a new oven for us today. I’m not ashamed to say that I did
                    a
                    little
                    dance when I found this unexpected surprise. Is this a sign that I’m getting older?
                    Uncontainable
                    excitement over a kitchen appliance? Maybe so - but my chicken nuggets have never tasted so
                    delicious.

                <h2>Sunday or Monday, the whatever of January - 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, you may be asking where have I been for the past four days? A weekend break away to a
                    European
                    capital? This time last year, I was making a spontaneous trip to Vienna. Was I visiting more of
                    the
                    UK,
                    Cardiff or Manchester? Maybe a sojourn to London to tick off more Shakespeare plays from my
                    checklist?
                    Well, actually I haven’t moved.
                    Starting last Thursday, I competed in my first Hackathon. That’s right, I’m officially a hacker.
                    <br><br>
                    For those of you that are ignorant of the most prestigious event on the ethical hacker’s
                    calendar, a
                    Hackathon is an event where teams come together to collaborate intensively on projects. These
                    projects
                    are typically software development, hardware engineering, or other creative problem-solving
                    activities.
                    There are no constraints but one guideline: Projects must use real-time processing. This is as
                    it
                    sounds; we must build a project that operates in dynamic environments, processing and responding
                    to
                    inputs or events as they occur. (These are things like ride-sharing apps, live-streaming
                    websites or
                    online videogames.)
                    <br><br>
                    So the seven of us gathered in Gateway House where we had access to cloud storage, a stable
                    internet
                    connection and the backing of the De Montfort Computing faculty. We were competing online so we
                    had
                    a
                    camera on us for four days straight; hence why we needed a stable internet connection. We had 96
                    hours
                    to plan, design, code, test, and present our project to the invigilators who I imagine were just
                    monitoring our screens for the entirety of that time.
                    <br><br>
                    Our project was a language app similar to google translate. We utilised AI and machine learning
                    language
                    models so a user can speak into it and the NLP (Natural Language Processor) can translate it
                    into
                    any of
                    the pre-selected languages. In the four days we were coding this, we managed to gain
                    functionality
                    for
                    over thirty languages. <em>Impressive, huh.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Because this is a four day Hackathon, we didn’t move from room 3.91 for the majority of that
                    time.
                    It’s
                    not like we could just take a few hours off to get some fresh air. When we weren’t working, we
                    were
                    sleeping. I never thought I would spend an evening cooped up inside a university building. It’s
                    nothing
                    like one would expect as a child; being able to roam freely around an abandoned building. Dilan
                    and
                    the
                    other committee members from the Hacking society had overnight bags. <em>This clearly wasn’t
                    their
                    first
                    rodeo.</em> I live five minutes away from the university so I came back to my bed every night
                    but
                    Saturday. Campus security knew we were there so didn’t call the Police on us when we were
                    entering
                    the
                    building at four o’clock in the morning.
                    <br><br>
                    Because the university needed to monitor us over the four days, we had brief respites when the
                    health
                    and wellbeing officer came in to check on our mental states. I thought this was a little extreme
                    and
                    ironic when they came in every few hours. On Thursday, we were all jovial, excited and fuelled
                    on
                    achieving potential greatness and immortality in the world of Computer Hackers. Friday, we were
                    less
                    enthusiastic and some of the lads were getting tired after coding for twenty-four hours
                    straight. I
                    went
                    home to sleep so I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. Saturday was intense. There was a lot to do
                    and
                    not
                    a lot was working. Sunday we were descending into madness. MADNESS I TELL YOU; MADNESS.
                    <br><br>
                    I have never been so sleep deprived. Saturday and Sunday merged into one. We were all sleeping
                    for
                    only
                    an hour at a time so we were all irritable and emotional. Jack was actually in tears when he was
                    pleading with his code to work. <em>“Speak to it softly, see if that makes a difference.”</em>
                    He
                    was in
                    no mood for my witty remarks; as I later found out when he threw a keyboard at me.
                    <br><br>
                    The vexation on Dilan’s face when he wandered over and I was watching the football was a sight
                    to
                    behold. <em>“Harry, do your job or I’ll hack your laptop.”</em> Normally, this would just be an
                    empty
                    threat but I’m sitting with six hackers who have been infiltrating security systems since before
                    they
                    had all their adult teeth.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long Saturday night, crying on the floor, sleeping for brief intervals under the desks,
                    words
                    don’t even look right anymore. A mixture between coding languages and looking at languages to
                    implement
                    into our app, I couldn’t think coherently. Why do words have one pronunciation but two
                    spellings?
                    <em>Queue.</em>
                    Is it a word? Why isn’t it spelt like <em>‘cue’</em>. Why is the English language a labyrinth of
                    silent
                    letters, bizarre rules, and exceptions to every rule? Why does <em>‘colonel’</em> sound like
                    <em>‘kernel’</em>?
                    Why do <em>‘tear’</em> and <em>‘tear’</em> mean two completely different things? <em>To,
                    two </em>&<em>too.
                    Their, there, they’re. THESE DON’T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE.</em> Why can’t we just use
                    <em>Newspeak</em>
                    from Orwells’ <em>nineteen-eighty-four</em>?
                    <br><br>
                    Sunday we were as coherent as zombies. We made the decision to get as much sleep as possible
                    before
                    we
                    presented on Sunday afternoon - or Dave (the Health & Wellbeing officer doing the rounds)
                    forcefully
                    instructed us. We managed to get everything working and the presentation went well.
                    <br><br>
                    We placed 7th out of 101 universities and private groups across the country. Hardy surprisingly
                    given
                    six out of seven of our team had real-world experience through internships at IBM, Barclays,
                    Visa
                    and
                    Meta. Very valuable experience, but not to worry because I brought my invaluable experience of
                    doing
                    an
                    erasmus year in Stockholm to the table…
                    <br><br>
                    So that was my past four days - five days. What day is it? I’ve still not fully caught up on my
                    sleep
                    because I can’t sleep during the day. I think maintenance has been in the kitchen doing repairs
                    all
                    afternoon. <em>The one day I could do with them pissing off…</em>

                    Aswany! That’s roommate A’s name! I finally overheard it while she was cooking for a friend she
                    had
                    over. I was in the kitchen - warming up a tomato soup dish I had frozen over the weekend - but I
                    couldn’t stop to chat anyway, because the spices that she was frying were actually causing me
                    pain.
                    By
                    the time the microwave pinged, my eyes were burning, and I was practically crying.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening marked the second meeting for our upcoming Paris trip. We’ve now been divided into
                    groups,
                    each assigned a specific task to research and present during our third meeting. My group is
                    responsible
                    for exploring restaurants and activities. Naturally, I’d prefer to keep the itinerary light,
                    leaving
                    ample room for my own adventures. However, I can’t deny the allure of persuading the group to
                    align
                    with
                    my plans. After all, if the stars align, there’s a chance DMUGlobal could cover travel and
                    expenses.
                    The Palace of Versailles, anyone?

                    I feel like such a twelve-year-old again. I walk into the kitchen, and there are all three of my
                    roommates cooking. Not together, like you’d picture in some wholesome sitcom, but
                    separately—which
                    means
                    there’s food EVERYWHERE. Meanwhile, I wander in, grab my chicken nuggets, throw them in the
                    oven,
                    and
                    I’m done.
                    <br><br>
                    I couldn’t help but notice the irony of it, seeing as I’m the oldest and the <em>man of the
                    house.</em>
                    God, that’s old-fashioned. <em>Gather round the wireless, bairns. Pick of the Pops will be on
                    soon.
                    Queue up the cassette player and get ready to hit record the moment the DJ shuts up. And while
                    we
                    wait,
                    let me tell you the legend of tape recorders and dial-up internet.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    All three of them had their headphones in. I thought the games night we had on Sunday might’ve
                    been
                    the
                    start of something, but no—it’s back to the status quo ante. Give them time.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, I have been busy with my FYP (final year project) today - ignoring the fact that
                    the
                    module doesn't even start for another three weeks. I don’t have a supervisor confirmed yet but I
                    know
                    presciently, if I show them a completed project in week two, they’ll do their best to come up
                    with
                    some
                    more superfluous features for me to add just so they can see that I’ve completed some additional
                    programming under their tutelage. I’ll have to momentarily delete pages and re-add them
                    incrementally so
                    I can show them that progress is being made; even if it is a convoluted way of approaching
                    things.

                    I ventured into the Watershed for my first game of football in ages and swiftly rediscovered why
                    I
                    don’t
                    play as much as I used to in my days at Stockholm University. Back then, the sessions were a
                    paragon
                    of
                    organisation. The sports hall staff presided over each game; everyone knew the rules, the
                    format,
                    and,
                    crucially, their place.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrast that with tonight’s shambles. Here, Futsal is run by the Futsal society—a group whose
                    collective
                    competence appears inversely proportional to their enthusiasm. Rule number one of the evening:
                    there
                    are
                    no
                    rules. No one seems to know what’s happening, and any attempt at structure is about as effective
                    as
                    a
                    blind
                    referee. Bibs were distributed, but apparently, wearing them is optional, making it neon
                    impossible
                    to
                    pick
                    out a teammate in this maelstrom of strangers.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I like to think I’m a reasonable man who seeks a gentle runabout—a convivial match where
                    the
                    only
                    bruises are to one’s ego. Alas, what transpired was more akin to guerrilla warfare. The
                    participants
                    were
                    gym lads who tackled like rhinos, clattering into everyone who was more nimble than they were -
                    so
                    everyone.
                    Knee-high challenges, stamping on ankles, double-footed lunges. Challenges were made with the
                    same
                    enthusiasm one might reserve for a medieval joust, and the offside rule was apparently a concept
                    too
                    avant-garde for this crowd.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of avant-garde, there was a goalkeeper who took the notion of physicality to a new
                    frontier
                    by
                    literally kicking players in protest of an "offside" goal. An offside goal! In indoor football!
                    The
                    irony
                    was not lost on me that more English was spoken during my Stockholm days than in this local
                    melee,
                    despite
                    it occurring in England.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to rise above it all. Really, I did. But after nutmegging the same lad thrice, he
                    decided
                    enough
                    was
                    enough and launched into me with a challenge that was less “competitive spirit” and more “I’m
                    out
                    for
                    blood.” The first two tackles I shrugged off with the magnanimity of a saint, but the
                    third—executed
                    at
                    thigh height—was too much. I’m generally a calm fellow, but even I have my limits.
                    <br><br>
                    Which brings us to the regrettable aerial duel. If you ask me now if I regret going into that
                    50/50
                    battle, <span id="style1" style="font-size: 10px">with my elbow;</span> I would probably say
                    yes.
                    Should
                    I
                    have sat out earlier, when the tone of the game turned gladiatorial? Definitely. But it was a
                    teachable
                    moment—retribution is a powerful force, just like my elbow.
                    <br><br>
                    Naturally, my act of appeasement marked the evening’s denouement. A staff member intervened,
                    reminding
                    us
                    that this was intended to be a light-hearted way to stay active, not a prelude to civil unrest.
                    As
                    we
                    trudged off the court in ignominy, he added, “If you’re keen to keep fighting, my new boxing
                    class
                    starts at
                    eight.”
                    <br><br>
                    Touché.

                <p>
                    Esther returned from her Christmas break today, radiating cheer. University of Leicester
                    students
                    always
                    seem this way—until the next term begins, and they’re reminded it’s just as challenging as the
                    last.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned yesterday, our affable new roommate proposed a quasi-family meal this evening. Is
                    this
                    the
                    beginning of genuine interpersonal friendships or simply the honeymoon phase of Roommate A’s
                    tenure
                    in
                    Leicester? Whatever the case, the evening turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. As expected,
                    Summer
                    was
                    absent throughout the evening, only materialising for a few moments for a snack break. At this
                    point, I
                    think she’s being purposely taciturn.
                    <br><br>
                    We played charades in the lounge, swapped anecdotes, and made memories—the sort of picturesque
                    student
                    life I thought only existed on the glossy covers of housing brochures. Esther even brought her
                    projector,
                    and we ended the evening watching <em>Dr. No.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    At one point, when Roommate A left the room, (I really must find out her name before it gets too
                    late!);
                    Esther leaned over and commented that my beard suited me. Clearly, this vixen has intentions of
                    wooing
                    me.

                    Finally spoke to my new roommate. She did tell me her name but I genuinely cannot remember it.
                    She’s
                    from India but grew up in Qatar. She seems cordial and very convivial. Amusingly, she was
                    perplexed
                    when
                    I told her that we don’t do apartment game nights or pub quizzes together. She did have the same
                    cold
                    welcome from Summer which I can’t say I’m surprised about. She spends the majority of the time
                    with
                    her
                    headphones on and only appears in the kitchen for noodles or takeaways. Anyway, roommate A, as
                    I'll
                    call
                    her temporarily, has suggested going out one day next week for a tete-a-tete.

                <h2>Friday, 10th January</h2>
                <p>
                    I was back in the radio studio this evening, and honestly, I’ve been itching to get my hands
                    back on
                    the
                    controls all week. Lantern, my presenter, was sitting across from me as usual. She kicked off
                    the
                    show
                    with her usual energy, introducing the segment and smoothly transitioning into tonight’s
                    playlist.
                    The
                    moment her mic was off, she turned to me and said with a gleeful grin, <em>“I made someone just
                    as
                    depressed as me today.”</em> Ugh, seriously? Guess we’re diving into the new year just as we
                    left
                    the
                    last one. I really need to find a way onto someone else’s show—it’s exhausting trying to laugh
                    and
                    smile
                    politely for two hours every Friday.
                    <br><br>
                    On a brighter note, we (DMU Hackers) just got the green light from DMU Security to run an
                    infiltration
                    exercise on one of the campus buildings. The wheels are turning now, and once the Leicester
                    Police
                    Cyber
                    Division is looped in and gives the final go-ahead, we’ll be off. When I say “infiltrate,” I
                    mean
                    we’ll
                    be working to penetrate the building’s IT systems. This involves using tools like IP addresses,
                    subnet
                    masks, virtual networks, packet tracking, and a whole bunch of other tech wizardry to breach the
                    servers.
                    <br><br>
                    If this were the real deal, the goal would be to gain access, modify, or even delete sensitive
                    data
                    on
                    those servers. But thankfully, this isn’t a Hollywood-style hackathon—this is a controlled
                    exercise
                    under the watchful eyes of DMU Security. Our mission is simple: break in, identify security
                    flaws,
                    and
                    help patch them up. Still, it’s exciting to be trusted with poking around the university’s IT
                    infrastructure.

                <h2>Thursday, 9th January</h2>
                <p>
                    Today marked my first seminar back with our antiquated professor, a man whose teaching feels
                    like he
                    could tell us what it was like discovering fire all those years ago. He got the job based on
                    three
                    papers he wrote during the dot-com boom of the late nineties—an era when the internet was
                    revolutionary,
                    and the IT sector was riding high. But nearly three decades later, with the industry now rooted
                    in
                    AI
                    and quantum computing, he’s still clinging to defunct companies and obsolete frameworks. Worse,
                    he’s
                    shoehorned his old research into the curriculum to ensure he profits from our suffering.
                    <br><br>
                    In a misguided attempt to make up for teaching us outdated material before Christmas, he’s now
                    drowning
                    us in work: fifteen research papers, four case analyses, seven literature reviews, and two
                    textbooks
                    we’re expected to loan from the library. Yes, the <em>library</em>. We’re studying Computer
                    Science,
                    and
                    we’re still reliant on tangible documents. The irony isn’t lost on me.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of the seminar, he cornered Dilan and me for feedback. I jumped in first—thankfully,
                    as
                    Dilan’s justified disdain might have been less tactfully expressed. I managed to voice our
                    concerns
                    diplomatically, avoiding outright insult while not absolving him either. Hopefully, our
                    magnanimity
                    will
                    count for something when he’s marking our assignments. For now though, I have an awful lot of
                    reading to
                    do.

                <h2>Wednesday, 8th January</h2>
                <p>Less than 24 hours in Leicester, and I’m already back on a train to London. My Shakespeare
                    matinee
                    streak
                    continues, and today it’s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> and <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>
                    on
                    the
                    schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    First stop: Trafalgar Theatre. I’ve been here before—it’s where I saw <em>The Duchess</em> with
                    Jodie
                    Whittaker—so I knew what to expect from the space and its tech. The stage backdrop doubles as a
                    projection screen, and while the effects were fun, they didn’t really add anything to the story.
                    (Same
                    as with <em>The Duchess</em>, honestly.)
                    <br><br>
                    Tracy-Ann Oberman played Shylock, the Jewish moneylender who demands a pound of flesh when a
                    loan
                    isn’t
                    repaid. She was amazing. But this version of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> was... complicated.
                    It’s
                    set in 1936, and while Shylock is still supposed to be the antagonist, the other characters are
                    part
                    of
                    the British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley. So, how are we meant to feel when Shylock
                    gets
                    tricked out of her bond—the one she’s rightfully owed? Are we happy because the “protagonists”
                    got
                    away
                    with it, or horrified because the fascists outsmarted the Jew?
                    <br><br>
                    They leaned into this tension hard. There were scenes showing protests and vandalism against
                    Shylock’s
                    home and possessions (not in the original text) and some added lines that highlighted the casual
                    antisemitism of the time. It made the stakes feel a lot higher.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, after the usual ending, there was a twist. Oberman delivered a monologue about her
                    great-grandmother, who fought the fascists when they tried to evict Jews from London
                    neighborhoods
                    in
                    1936. It was clearly aimed at the audience, urging kindness and acceptance of different
                    cultures. It
                    felt a bit tacked on—like an addendum to the play—but at least they kept it to the end instead
                    of
                    working it into the story itself.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> has always been one of my favorites because of how strong the
                    story
                    is.
                    This version was wildly different but still stayed true to the main themes. It’s definitely
                    sticking
                    with me. That said, I couldn’t figure out who I was supposed to root for: the Jewish moneylender
                    who’s
                    out for literal blood, or the fascists who manipulate her and walk away unscathed. It’s messy,
                    but
                    maybe
                    that’s the point.
                    <br><br>
                    Next up: <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. But before we get into the magic of the play, let
                    me
                    just
                    say—the Barbican is a maze. The neighborhood is pristine, upper-class, and charming but not in a
                    presumptuous way. But for a tourist? Not exactly user-friendly. I spent a good half hour
                    wandering
                    around before finally tracking down the theatre.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, onto the show: It was fantastic. There’s a reason why <em>Midsummer</em> is one of
                    Shakespeare’s
                    greatest hits. The themes are straightforward, which makes it the perfect playground for
                    different
                    interpretations. This production ran three hours but felt like no time at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Quick digression: the Barbican Theatre itself? Weird setup. The tiers are super narrow - two or
                    three
                    rows max - but they wrap all the way around to the stage corners. It’s like the Globe, but
                    without
                    the
                    charm. I was up in the fourth tier, and the view made me feel a little dizzy, peering over the
                    edge
                    of
                    the balcony. By the second half, I’d had enough and made a bold move. I shuffled my way down to
                    the
                    first-row stalls. Yep, the £270 seats. Claimed them like I belonged there all along. Do anything
                    with
                    confidence and people will not question it. And honestly? Worth it. I was so close I could feel
                    the
                    actors’ presence—literally. The swish of Lysander’s cloak brushed past me, and I could
                    practically
                    hear
                    the creak of Demetrius’ boots as he stomped across the stage. I even caught the subtle twitch of
                    Mathew
                    Baynton’s eyelid while he was playing dead. Forget immersive theatre—this was Shakespeare in
                    high
                    definition.
                    <br><br>
                    This production of Midsummer was pure joy from start to finish. The boys get the girls, they
                    have a
                    dance, the King gives his blessing for his daughter to marry the man she loves and they all live
                    happily
                    ever after. Shakespeare in a nutshell. Puck wrapped it up with a perfect poetic soliloquy,
                    leaving
                    us
                    with smiles and a renewed belief in the magic of live theatre.

                    Out of all the trips I’ve made to London over the past few months, these shows rank near the
                    top.

                <p>
                    The new year has barely begun, and Leicester has already decided to humble me. I stepped into my
                    flat,
                    greeted not by warm vibes or resolutions, but by the cold, harsh reality of a broken oven and
                    hob.
                    Barely 2025 and my last semester in Leicester is off to a rocky start. I trotted down to the
                    office
                    to
                    see what they know and Connor has assured me, he’s on the case.
                    <br><br>
                    While I was there, I also learned a bit more about my new roommate. Female. Born 2002. Masters
                    student
                    at UoL, studying Media. That’s all I know. Oh, and that Marvin isn’t returning. RIP to the
                    cutlery
                    thief
                    and good riddance. And cheers to Unite Students for their stellar adherence to GDPR. Asking if
                    anyone
                    had moved in somehow got me their life story. I mean, I basically know her shoe size and
                    favorite
                    snack
                    at this point—just missing a name. Mysterious.

                <p>
                    I always sleep better in Liam’s bed than in my own. I really need to find out where he got his
                    duvet.
                    This morning started lazily - just killing time before heading off to the Sam Wanamaker
                    Playhouse
                    for
                    <em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse is unlike any theatre I’ve been to before. The entire performance
                    was
                    candlelit, and while I assumed that was just some modern-classical gimmick, it turned out to be
                    as
                    literal as it sounded. As an RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) production, there were no
                    microphones,
                    sound effects, or modern lighting - just hundreds of candles illuminating the stage and the
                    auditorium.
                    The result was a cosy, intimate atmosphere. However, there was one thing I hadn’t anticipated:
                    it
                    was
                    boiling.
                    <br><br>
                    At first, I thought the fans being sold in the reception area were meant to make the audience
                    feel
                    like
                    Shakespearean aristocracy. By Act III, I realised their true purpose: survival. I was
                    practically
                    melting and spent the interval standing outside in the 5°C chill, just to cool down.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the heat, the performance was spectacular. The RSC rarely disappoints, and this was no
                    exception. They remained true to the source material while adding their own clever twists.
                    Shakespeare
                    loved a bit of cross-dressing, with men pretending to be women and vice versa, so it’s always
                    fun to
                    see
                    directors lean into that with modern gender swaps. In this adaptation, a woman played one of the
                    male
                    characters disguised as a woman, which gave a fresh dynamic to the play. As always with
                    Shakespeare,
                    the
                    boys got the girls, there was singing and dancing, and everything ended happily ever after. A
                    wonderful
                    afternoon at the theatre.
                    <br><br>
                    The train ride back to Darlington was uneventful but felt oddly ominous. Unlike previous years,
                    there
                    wasn’t the usual thrill of going home. No magnetic pull drawing me back. This time, I felt like
                    I
                    should
                    have stayed in Leicester a bit longer. If I were still there I would be building the website for
                    Demon
                    magazine, producing radio shows, analysing data from the Racers’ lap-time simulations. While I’m
                    happy
                    to be home, a part of me feels like I should have postponed the trip for a few more days.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, now that I’m here, it’s time to embrace Christmas. These blogs are meant to capture my
                    day-to-day
                    life at university, the odd and wonderful things I experience in Leicester. But for now, it’s
                    time
                    to
                    pause. Time to catch up with old friends, wrap Christmas presents, and fully enjoy the holiday
                    season.
                    See you in the new year when I have the second semester to enjoy.

                <h2>Friday, 13th December</h2>
                <p>
                    Friday the thirteenth. Today is supposed to be a day of bad luck, but after my fortunes last
                    night,
                    I
                    think there’s only good luck left in the tank. It’s my final morning in Leicester, with little
                    left
                    to
                    do but submit coursework and tidy my room. In the past, I’ve always had a clear idea of my
                    predicted
                    grade for assignments, guided by realistic assumptions and some measure of confidence. This
                    time,
                    however, feels like an outlier: the teaching was incoherent, the specifications labyrinthine,
                    and
                    the
                    resources more contradictory than the bootstrap paradox. Love it or hate it, it’s done. I can
                    finally
                    exhale - and look forward to the season preview of <em>The Tempest</em> featuring Sigourney
                    Weaver
                    and
                    Mathew Horne.
                    <br><br>
                    When I get around to writing my review of the play, I think my tagline will be: “A glorious
                    opportunity,
                    wasted.” For a theatre as grand as Royal Drury Lane, it didn’t make use of its opulent setting.
                    Signourney’s character, <em>Prospero</em>, is supposed to command the stage, order the
                    audience’s
                    focus
                    by decree, unfortunately, Signourney’s interpretation of the role debased Prospero’s role down
                    to a
                    glorified narrator. I also suspect that Signourney has had some dental work done because that
                    would
                    explain why she turned every ‘s’ sound into a ‘th’.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><em>‘Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all
                        spirits’</em></strong> turned into <strong><em>‘Our revelth now are ended. Theth our
                    actorths,
                    as I
                    foretold you, were all piriths’</em></strong>. It would have been funny had this been a unique
                    adaptation
                    of the Shakespeare comedy, however I don’t think this was intended.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t one of the better plays I’ve seen but that might be down to <em>The Tempest</em> being
                    a
                    weaker script than <em>MacBeth</em> and <em>The Duchess of Malfi.</em> Nevertheless this
                    production
                    fell
                    short of the expectations - especially when the A-list stars are expected to carry the show.

                <h2>Thursday, 12th December</h2>
                <p>
                    I must apologise for yesterday’s ramblings. I was supposed to explicate my all-start performance
                    on
                    the
                    Futsal court consisting of hat tricks, skills, a penalty save, even a successful rainbow flick
                    that
                    prompted the return of the <em>‘Cole Palmer’</em> nickname. Instead a group of miscreants were
                    smoking
                    copious amounts of marajuana under my bedroom window which unlocked a slightly bemusing allegory
                    about
                    my prejudice on the abilities of the players based on their choice of footwear…
                    <br><br>
                    Onto today’s thrilling events. I had another confusing seminar with Neil that was filled with
                    contradictory advice and unusable resources, a sit-down with the careers advisor who advised me
                    to
                    ‘pick
                    a career in <em>computering</em>’ - her words verbatim. And an admonition from UniteStudents
                    about
                    alleged smoking in the flat. Whether they meant cigarettes or something stronger, I have no
                    idea,
                    but I
                    suspect they’ve mistaken the aroma wafting in from the street last night as originating from
                    inside.
                    Let’s hope I don’t return in the new year to find my belongings packed up and eviction papers on
                    my
                    desk
                    because of someone else’s antics.
                    <br><br>
                    Marvin’s moving out today too. You know, that thirty year old bloke who was stealing my cutlery.
                    I
                    found
                    him lugging five suitcases out to the lift. I could have helped but he stole my cutlery.
                    <br><br>
                    This means that I’m either getting a new roommate for the new year or I’m going to be in a flat
                    with
                    only Esther and Summer. I’m fine with either scenario but if I do get another roommate then
                    they’ll
                    likely be an exchange student or on placement seeing as there’s only six months of the academic
                    year
                    remaining.
                    <br><br>
                    Tonight was our Hackers Christmas meal, and naturally, we gathered at our trusted haunt, Soar
                    Point.
                    The
                    meal was nothing short of delightful - one of the best I’ve had in a long while. But if I’m
                    honest,
                    the
                    portion size could have fed me for three meals. Ironically, while I felt overwhelmed by the
                    sheer
                    volume, everyone else complained that the servings were too small. Determined not to waste any,
                    I
                    pushed
                    on, trying to eat more.
                    <br><br>
                    Big mistake.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed was the most nauseating experience I’ve endured since the infamous events of
                    November
                    15th
                    last year.
                    <br><br>
                    The mere thought of throwing up is enough to send my mind into a relentless whirlpool, what if
                    it
                    happens in public, what if I can’t find a way to stop it, what if it hurts, what if I choke,
                    what if
                    people see and judge me, what if it never stops, the questions spiral faster and faster until
                    I’m
                    left
                    paralysed, my heart pounding, my breath shallow, my body bracing for a disaster that may never
                    come
                    but
                    feels inevitable, my stomach twists as though it’s already happening, my throat tightens in
                    preemptive
                    dread, the room seems to close in, every sound feels sharper, every movement magnified, and I
                    wonder
                    if
                    this will be the moment, the moment I lose control completely, the moment my worst fear
                    manifests,
                    the
                    moment I’m proven right to always worry, and yet even in the midst of this storm I know I’m
                    trapped
                    by
                    my own mind, the fear feeding on itself, growing stronger with every panicked thought, every
                    beat of
                    my
                    racing heart, until there’s nothing left but the overwhelming certainty that escape is
                    impossible,
                    and I
                    am entirely at its mercy.
                    <br><br>
                    To stop these spiraling thoughts, I need a distraction. An activity, a walk, something to focus
                    my
                    mind,
                    bring me back to reality and not the maelstrom of my distorted reverie. I’m unlikely to overcome
                    this
                    fear unless faced with something entirely out of my control. Perhaps that would be for the best
                    - a
                    forceful, inexorable event to conquer my most deep-seated fear.
                    <br><br>
                    Most people when posed with the hypothetical choice - five minutes of discomfort for a lifetime
                    of
                    peace
                    or a lifetime of lingering unease - the choice seems obvious. Most would pick the brief
                    discomfort
                    to
                    escape the relentless torment. Yet for me, the idea of enduring even those five minutes is
                    paralysing.
                    After eight years of building this fear into an insurmountable adversary, the prospect feels
                    like
                    staring into an abyss.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time I’d calmed down, my desert was waiting for me though I’d already surpassed the point
                    of
                    overindulgence. It became a waiting game - an effort to endure the aftermath and wait for this
                    episode
                    to pass.
                    <br><br>
                    A bittersweet end to my last night in Leicester for the year.

                <h2>Wednesday, 11th December</h2>
                <p>
                    I honoured my fellow futsal players with my presence this evening. It was a very discerning
                    session.
                    I
                    can separate these people into two groups, almost as clearly as Montagues and Capulets. The
                    dichotomy is
                    telling even though each player is as distinct as the next. We arrived individually but were
                    grouped
                    all
                    as one. We sat side by side. Lacing up. Waiting for instructions like soldiers about to go over
                    the
                    barricades. The captains make their selections based on their own myopic biases. But I look at
                    these
                    people through the labyrinth of my own caste. A framework of my own making. Let me show you.
                    <br><br>
                    Those who came to participate wear comfy, multi-functional trainers. Such like the ones you see
                    in
                    shop
                    windows across the country. Trendy and modern. Bought at an inflated price tag just to
                    accentuate
                    the
                    opulence of the purchase. Kept in a condition which says ‘I am proud to be wearing the latest
                    editions’.
                    Don’t be fooled. This is just a facade for those who are actually drowning in diffidence.
                    Highlighting
                    the imposters among the elite as obviously as a peasant assimilating the role of an aristocrat.
                    No
                    matter how eloquent their elocution or ornate their apparel, they cannot shake their ignoble
                    caste.
                    They
                    will soon be rooted out in game time. The menial positions are reserved for them while the
                    artisans
                    lead
                    the line.
                    <br><br>
                    The artists among the philistines. The roses in the cauldron of thorns. These are the people who
                    are
                    ready to play. And play to win. Not wearing any boots but in fact, astro turf boots, despite
                    knowing
                    we
                    are playing indoors. Those who know that the extra grip on the varnished floor is the difference
                    between
                    preeminence and mediocracy. These boots have had the shine worn off them from perpetual wear and
                    the
                    season long abuse from the owner. These boots which have scuffs and tears from leaving tackles
                    on
                    opposing players. These boots which can tell a story of triumph and desecration. Laces which
                    have
                    been
                    replaced and replaced again. Like a classical musician restringing his bass. The pride and joy
                    of
                    one's
                    life. The tools to deliver the result. That is how I separate the sublime from the malign.
                    <br><br>
                    Just when I have correctly deduced the skills and capabilities of the ones who play, we have an
                    aberration. An outlier. One who chose a third root, exempting themselves from my binary
                    bifurcation.
                    Bare foot. An unknown quantity. This is a man who chooses the difficult path regardless of the
                    consequences. Ready to face the risk with mirth and tenacity. Adroitly, masking his talents.
                    Hiding
                    from
                    my frightful sight. Obstructing the natural order with disregard and guile. But no man is truly
                    exempt.
                    There is no room for anomalies in my game for we are artists of our craft.
                    <br><br>
                    The main event, the raison d’etre, the tapestry of time that we await to indicate the beginning
                    of
                    our
                    meagre time together. The whistle. A pitch so high that conveys only one interpretation. And so
                    we
                    begin.

                <h2>Tuesday, 10th December</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s make-or-break time. Everyone’s panicking because the first part of our coursework is due in
                    three
                    days. No one is entirely sure what is expected or pertinent to include. By way of reparations,
                    my
                    lecturer has benevolently decided to give up his time to catch us up on the work he should have
                    been
                    teaching us for the past two weeks. The only time he could manage was 6–7 pm. <em>How generous
                    of
                    him.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, I have a Dilan. Normally, lecturers rely on him to add some much-needed context to
                    their
                    content, but today, Dilan crossed the boundary from erudite student to teacher - informing Neil
                    on
                    the
                    direction the module was going and what needed to be included in the assignments. Does that make
                    me
                    a
                    teacher’s pet? What’s ironic is that Neil is the one marking the assessments, so it fills me
                    with
                    trepidation that even he doesn’t know what’s going on. <em>“What day of the week is it
                    Neil?”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    On a lighter note, the Xmas exchange event took place this afternoon. Twenty students studying
                    at
                    DMU
                    rallied together for an afternoon of quizzes, Secret Santa, Pictionary and mince pies. We’re
                    giving
                    them
                    the full British Crimbo experience. One of the quiz rounds was “Name the movie title and the
                    year it
                    was
                    released.” I nailed every single one: <em>The Holiday</em>? Check. <em>Love Actually</em>? Come
                    on,
                    make
                    it difficult for me. <em>It’s a Wonderful Life</em>? Do I get bonus points for naming the
                    top-billed
                    cast, production studio, writer, and director?
                    <br><br>
                    Talking of films, I saw Red One at the cinema with Natalia and Emily this evening. It wasn’t a
                    good
                    film, but it’s the sort of Christmas fun that puts you in the mood for the holidays. We had a
                    good
                    natter when we got back to their flat, and because it was late and torrential rain was pouring
                    outside,
                    I crashed on their sofa. Surprisingly comfy. It’s good to know I’ve got somewhere I’m welcome to
                    stay if
                    I ever get locked out.

                    No one enjoys job hunting. It’s tedious but necessary. Whether it’s internships, graduate
                    positions,
                    or
                    work experience, the application process demands the same level of effort: tailoring CVs,
                    researching
                    companies, and convincing them that working for them would, without question, be the single
                    greatest
                    achievement you could hope for all while maintaining an air of professionalism and gravitas.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. Casting a wide net across various positions doesn’t
                    necessarily
                    improve the odds of success either. The job market is a cruel mistress.
                    <br><br>
                    I had been expecting an email from East Midlands Chamber confirming an interview for a summer
                    internship. When I followed up this week, I discovered that the university’s careers team hadn’t
                    forwarded my details, and the position had already been filled. This process is hard enough
                    without
                    my
                    university dropping the ball too!

                <h2>Sunday, 8th December</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of this weekend, I had ambitious plans: spend a productive few days catching up on
                    the
                    material we were supposed to have covered in seminars and begin dissecting the first part of the
                    coursework due Friday. Unfortunately, none of this has come to fruition.
                    <br><br>
                    Normally, I’m well-organised, with academic responsibilities firmly prioritised over social
                    activities.
                    But this coursework is proving confusing and utterly perplexing, largely because we haven’t been
                    taught
                    any of the content. I might as well be sitting a medical exam - I know as much about
                    appendectomies
                    as I
                    do about software methodology strategies. Thanks to our lecturer’s blunders, we’ve been left in
                    a
                    precarious imbroglio, along with the department. It’ll be interesting to see how they plan to
                    fix
                    this
                    mess. I’m hoping for a deadline extension or at least some extra support, though I suspect
                    that’s
                    optimistic.
                    <br><br>
                    When faced with an academic impasse, I have a tradition: hit Soar Point, the hub of all
                    student-related
                    fun and society business. It also helps that the last race of the 2024 calendar was on, which
                    meant
                    a
                    great turnout from the lads. Vivisect was there, the visible red mark on his cheek serving as a
                    reminder
                    of last night’s antics. He kept shooting me unforgiving looks, though every time Veronika and I
                    exchanged glances, we couldn’t help but giggle.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, everyone made it home safely after last night’s chaos. Michael looked a little worse
                    for
                    wear after his dance-floor dispute, but credit where it’s due - he stood his ground, even on
                    something
                    as inconsequential as debating the greatest F1 drivers of all time.
                    <br><br>
                    The race itself was a spectacle, capped off with a touching homage to Lewis Hamilton. There was
                    plenty
                    of grimacing after Verstappen took out Piastri on the first lap, but all was forgiven as McLaren
                    hoisted
                    the constructors' championship trophy.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the football was on afterward, I ended up spending the entire afternoon and evening at the
                    pub. So
                    much for having a productive weekend.

                <h2>Saturday, 7th December</h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, what a day! The DMURacers had scheduled an impromptu Christmas session, as many of the lads
                    are
                    leaving next Friday to go back home, making this weekend the last opportunity for a gathering. I
                    don’t
                    drink, but I still succumbed to peer pressure from the lads and joined them. It’s not my usual
                    social
                    scene, but in my quest to become the social butterfly I so desperately aspire to be, I followed
                    the
                    phalanx of racers to the train station. Where were we going? We didn’t know until we saw the
                    boards.
                    I
                    told you it was impromptu.
                    <br><br>
                    Destination: Stamford. Not anywhere near Stamford Bridge or even anywhere in that general
                    direction
                    but
                    a town east of Leicester.
                    <br><br>
                    “It has a Waitrose, Homebase and a football stadium so it’s bound to have a good selection of
                    boozers.”
                    <br><br>
                    Leaving a full three minutes till the train came, we finalised our decision and rushed to the
                    machines
                    to purchase our tickets.
                    <br><br>
                    There were around 15 of us on this expedition to Stamford, but let me introduce you to the key
                    players
                    in this anecdote: Curtis, the team technician; James, the team leader; Michael, Midlands
                    go-karting
                    champion; Dani, F1 statistician; Vivisect (nicknamed because he once owned a cat that he - well,
                    never
                    mind); Veronika, aspiring lesbian after watching the Lionesses at the Euros; and Dan, alcoholic.
                    <br><br>
                    What did I bring to this talented group? I was the peacekeeper, thanks to my sobriety and my
                    tendency to
                    diffuse heated situations.
                    <br><br>
                    The first few pubs were uneventful - food, darts, drinks, and even a pub quiz at our third stop.
                    All
                    fun
                    and games. James and Curtis, being of a similar age, carried themselves like old men at the pub:
                    convivial, treating everyone like old friends. It’s an unspoken language one learns through
                    years of
                    drinking in pubs. Michael regaled us with his latest victory on the circuit, while Dan and
                    Vivisect
                    unsuccessfully tried to flirt with the locals. Everyone’s ears perked up, however, when we
                    reached
                    the
                    F1 round of the quiz. F1 is to the racers, what Doctor Who is to the Hackers. It’s great to see
                    such
                    passion bringing people together.
                    <br><br>
                    As it got later, the clubs started opening. As Team Leader, James had unilateral control over
                    the
                    itinerary. Marching with a purposeful gait and google maps open, we landed in club #1. For the
                    record,
                    clubbing is not my scene. I don’t like loud music, I don’t like shouting, I don’t like drinking,
                    I
                    don’t
                    like the sticky floors, and I don’t like the smell of wet dog and stale alcohol permeating the
                    air.
                    <em>Get
                        me back home where I’ll be in bed with a good book and lights out at a reasonable hour.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Despite my grievances, I do like to dance. I have rhythm and enough moves in my repertoire to
                    make
                    Frank
                    Sinatra smile. Plus, it was amusing to observe our band of misfits in their attempts to impress
                    the
                    locals. Do chat-up lines still work? Did they ever? That didn’t stop Dan and Vivisect from
                    trying.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else
                        disappears.”</strong>
                    Lighthearted, flattering without being over the top. Solid 7/10.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk past again?”</strong> Cheeky
                    and
                    fun
                    but old and overused. 4/10.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Lucky for you, I’m pissed so you’ve gone from a 3 to an 8. Let’s go into the
                        disables?"</strong>(Vivisect still has that red mark across his face when I’m writing this
                    up
                    two
                    days later.)
                    <br><br>
                    Michael and Veronica were spectating too but they were far more interested in the day’s F1
                    events
                    than
                    to participate in this modern ritual. Especially seeing what can happen if it goes wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    Later that evening in the same club, much to our surprise, Vivisect and Dan were actually
                    entertaining
                    female company at the table down from us. Eavesdropping surreptitiously, we struggled to
                    suppress
                    our
                    laughter. It was like watching a penguin try to salsa dance - awkward, yet mesmerising in its
                    chaotic,
                    flipper-flapping way.
                    <br><br>
                    James and Curtis herded us all to the next club. I got to see a few of the sights in this pretty
                    little
                    town. Less pretty now after some of the boys had left their mark but nonetheless, it had the
                    ethereal
                    tranquility of the village from <em>Hot Fuzz</em>. We soldiered on, accompanied by Dan and
                    Vivisect’s
                    dalliances. A certain lexicon emerges on nights out - words I hadn’t heard since my drinking
                    days at
                    West Park when I was fifteen. “Mortalled.” “Peeved.” “Curved.” What does “curved” mean in this
                    context?
                    Intoxicated? Regretful? Subtext for “I’m going to go home and rethink my life”? Probably not.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t until we reached the second club that everything went arse over tit. I was standing
                    around
                    a
                    table with Dani, James, and Curtis - we were the ‘supervisors’ among these children. Dani is
                    perpetually
                    broke but has an uncanny talent for <em>utilising her assets</em>, as she puts it, to score free
                    drinks.
                    I’ve seen her skills in action, and they could genuinely be a case study in psychology. It’s
                    frightening
                    how easily she can manipulate men, even for something as trivial as the chance of a dance later
                    on.
                    The
                    strategic hair flick helps, too. It’s not quite as iconic as Gilda’s, but it’s certainly
                    effective.
                    Men
                    are so simple... apparently.
                    <br><br>
                    Dan and Vivisect had joined us at the table with their dates - persisting with their brazen
                    coquetry.
                    Meanwhile, Michael managed to upset someone on the dance floor. I later learned that it all
                    started
                    as a
                    debate about the greatest F1 driver of all time - an unusual topic for a nightclub conversation
                    with
                    strangers. But you must understand, this is all Michael talks about: cars, karting, and F1.
                    Michael
                    argued for Hamilton, while the other guy - a bloke who looked about forty - stood firm on Senna.
                    What
                    began as a harmless discussion quickly escalated into a full-blown altercation. Though I was
                    there
                    in my
                    quasi-role as peacekeeper, I knew better than to intervene once this guy started throwing his
                    weight
                    around.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as we see the commotion on the dance floor, James and Curtis rush in like the protective
                    older
                    brothers. They are solid so I had no doubt that they would be able to handle the situation. Dan
                    and
                    Vivisect, however; I think a strong wind would blow them over - especially after the copious
                    quantities
                    of alcohol they’d consumed.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe it was just to look heroic in front of their dates, a burst of Dutch courage, or plain old
                    drunken
                    indecision. Either way, Dan and Vivisect charged into the fray, leaving Veronika and me at the
                    table
                    to
                    enjoy the unexpected aftermath of their efforts. As the chaos unfolded, Veronika struck up a
                    conversation with the girl Dan had been unsuccessfully courting all night. It turned out the
                    girl
                    wasn’t
                    the <em>straight</em> shooter as we had all thought - or maybe she was just after free drinks.
                    Either
                    way, Veronika ended up kissing her, which seemed to confirm her suspicions about herself. She
                    was no
                    longer just <em>aspiring</em> - her newfound confidence earned her a round of celebratory
                    congratulations, so felicitations to her.
                    <br><br>
                    For my part, Jessica, who had been with Vivisect all evening, decided she preferred someone
                    sober
                    and
                    unmarked to Vivisect’s alcohol-soaked charms and the giant red slap mark on his face. I was in
                    the
                    right
                    place, right time; and certainly not complaining. While Dan and Vivisect played the part of
                    gallant
                    (if
                    misguided) knights, Veronika and I reaped the rewards of their valiant missteps. Heroes come in
                    all
                    forms, and on this night, we were the ones to answer the call. I guess I am a lover; not a
                    fighter
                    afterall.
                    <br><br>
                    With the equivalent of a <em>Ballroom Biltz</em> erupting in the club, the chaos of the night
                    culminated
                    in all of us being escorted out by bouncers. The commotion probably made their night, given the
                    usual
                    tranquility of this quaint town. With the last train to Leicester about to leave, it was a
                    fitting
                    end
                    to our Christmas bash. Dan and Vivisect were understandably incensed at our triumphs, but it
                    didn’t
                    bother us. We were drunk on stolen glory and the absurdity of the night - a kind of intoxication
                    no
                    liquor could replicate.
                    <br><br>
                    So, my first Christmas social: darts, quizzes, dancing, fighting, triumphs, regrets, and
                    unrequited
                    victories. A strong start to the festive season. Here’s hoping the Hackers’ Christmas meal
                    follows a
                    similar path.

                    Software Methods and Standards - the only thing that I’ve been ranting on about on a daily basis
                    -
                    has
                    taken a severe turn for the worst. We have our first deadline a week from today and our lecturer
                    has
                    taken this opportunity to inform us that he’s been teaching us the material scheduled for the
                    new
                    year.
                    I wish I could vindicate him by saying that’s why the course has felt so disjointed but I think
                    that’s
                    just his pedagogy style. To aid us in catching up, he has generously given up his time next
                    week, to
                    cover the scheduled seminars. At this point, I want all the material to be released online
                    because
                    I’m
                    sure Google will be more informative and coherent than this lecturer.
                    <br><br>
                    Friday night is my night producing in the Radio studio. I’ve mentioned previously how I’ve
                    become a
                    steady hand in producing, gaining the trust of my presenters, so now I’ve been offered another
                    night
                    in
                    addition to my current slot to further hone my skills. I’ve decided to postpone this decision
                    till
                    the
                    new year since I’ll be leaving this time next week so it’s hardly the time to be making new
                    commitments.
                    <br><br>
                    From the interest garnered from the freshers events in October and November, it sounds like
                    there
                    are
                    going to be a number of new shows in 2025 so I will be more than happy to just ship to produce
                    any
                    of
                    those. It has started to become a little irksome, hearing my presenters repeat the same phrases
                    after
                    each song. ‘I just love that song’. ‘It really speaks to me’. ‘This is what I love about radio,
                    sharing
                    new songs with you all’.
                    <br><br>
                    If I need to do another six months with these two, I might just go <em>radio gaga.</em>

                    The coursework has been released for the module and I’m still unclear about what the purpose of
                    the
                    module is. It’s not looking good. The first deadline is next Friday when the semester ends. The
                    second
                    and third deadline is the end of the module at the end of January. A positive to derive from the
                    situation is, I have plenty of time to do googling and researching because these lecturers are
                    just
                    making an already confusing module incomprehensible. I wonder how others are fairing. I know
                    Dillan
                    is
                    in the same position as I am so it’s not just me not being a dullard.

                    I
                    cannot
                    overstate this enough - I was not the Health and Lifestyle editor for this edition, therefore
                    have
                    not
                    proofread any other articles but my own. Now that I’ve vindicated myself for the errors
                    permeating

                <p>
                    The time is upon us! The official first edition of the Demon magazine under the new
                    editor-in-chief
                    is
                    here: Issue 53. I’ve seen the online copy and had some concerns. Unfortunately, seeing the
                    printed
                    version only confirmed them. The margins cut off the start of some paragraphs, and the designers
                    turned
                    some pieces from magazine articles into what look like leaflets. (You’ll see what I mean when I
                    link
                    it.) Thankfully, my pages look respectable, so that’s all I’m focusing on. It’s a bit
                    embarrassing
                    for
                    the current editors, who proofread these articles only to leave egregious mistakes, but that’s
                    their
                    problem—not mine.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, the first meeting for the Paris trip happened this evening. The fifteen or so
                    people
                    who
                    showed up were very easy to get along with and shared some interesting stories about their
                    motivations
                    for going. Some were equivocal, following the careers team’s lead by citing the terrific
                    opportunities
                    this trip could offer and the industry connections we could make. Others were more
                    straightforward
                    and
                    mentioned their desire to see the Eiffel Tower. My answer was a subtle mix of both.

                    Since it was just a meet-and-greet, we played a few games, participated in quizzes about Paris,
                    and
                    did
                    some team-building exercises. We also went over the itinerary, which I think is perfect. We’ll
                    depart
                    from London St Pancras at half past three, arriving in Paris at 7 p.m. On Tuesday, we have an
                    introduction and tasks led by Tanium, the cybersecurity company. Wednesday and Thursday are free
                    days,
                    with only an alumni dinner planned with former De Montfort students now living in Paris. This
                    gives
                    me
                    plenty of time to see the sights: The Louvre, Versailles, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,
                    Jardin
                    des Tuileries, and even enjoy a cruise down the Seine River. If I have time, I’d love to catch a
                    production of <em>Les Misérables</em>. Even if it’s in its native language, it would certainly
                    be an
                    unforgettable experience.

                <h2>Tuesday, 3rd December</h2>
                <p>
                    The BBC open call deadline closed at midday today, and I’m relieved to have submitted my pilot
                    manuscript over the weekend. Scriptwriting is a completely new skill for me, so I was learning
                    on
                    the
                    fly to ensure it met industry standards. Honestly, I find it less stressful than novel
                    writing—there’s
                    no need to obsess over intricate descriptions of surroundings. Just dialogue, a few stage
                    directions,
                    and done. There’s no word on the website about when feedback will be provided, probably because
                    it
                    depends on when they finish reviewing submissions. I’m not desperate for this to lead to a job,
                    but
                    I’m
                    definitely eager to get some constructive feedback on my work.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon should have been dedicated to three hours of Software Methods and Standards, a
                    session
                    that usually feels like a marathon. But today was different. When I arrived, the Hawthorne
                    building—home
                    to the Health and Science labs—was locked, and all the students were gathered on the grass
                    outside.
                    Speculation was rife: a chemical leak? Poison gas? An Ebola outbreak? Nobody had any answers,
                    but
                    the
                    gossip alone almost made the trip worthwhile.
                    <br><br>
                    Under normal circumstances, I’d celebrate an unexpected free afternoon. I’d head home, put on a
                    film,
                    maybe get some writing done, or tinker with my website. But missing this session actually
                    frustrated
                    me.
                    I’m already grappling with the purpose of this module, and skipping lectures and seminars isn’t
                    helping
                    to clarify things. Still, there wasn’t much to do but head home.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve nearly finished my writing portfolio, though I still need to rework my website's style. The
                    feedback I’ve received so far keeps pointing out its uncanny resemblance to the BBC site, so
                    that’s
                    something to tackle over the holidays. With the Christmas break starting in a week and a half,
                    it’ll
                    keep me busy and productive. I’ve also got to squeeze in Christmas shopping for my Leicester
                    friends
                    before next Friday, so the next few days are shaping up to be full-on.

                <h2>Monday, 2nd December</h2>
                <p>I got my first glimpse of the magazine today, and overall, it looks professional. It’s sleek and
                    well-designed on many pages. However, it’s clear the designers weren’t informed about the page
                    margins,
                    which will result in some content being cut off during printing. As a result, some pages will
                    appear
                    disjointed due to text being lost in the process. While the online version will be fine, that
                    doesn’t
                    excuse the chief designers for not properly briefing their team.
                    <br><br>
                    The magazine is thirty-two pages long, featuring around eighteen articles—a solid achievement,
                    especially since previous editions only reached a total of eighteen pages. I met with Jess, the
                    editor-in-chief, to discuss the website (which is outdated and visibly in need of a refresh).
                    During
                    our
                    meeting, she also brought up several issues with the magazine that go beyond design. It turns
                    out
                    the
                    section editors are either careless proofreaders or dyslexic—perhaps both. Regardless, they
                    shouldn’t
                    have volunteered for the job if they weren’t confident in their skills. There were spelling
                    mistakes,
                    grammatical errors, and even a random sentence in the middle of one page where the editor had
                    forgotten
                    to copy the entire text into the final draft. Fortunately, my sections were written and edited
                    by
                    me, so
                    they were error-free. As a result, Jess has asked me to take on the role of Health and Lifestyle
                    editor,
                    thanks to my meticulous eye for detail—and, of course, my lack of dyslexia.
                    <br><br>
                    Jess and her friends are studying journalism, so this is their area of expertise. For me, this
                    is
                    just
                    another opportunity to branch out beyond my Computer Science degree. Apparently, all journalism
                    students
                    are encouraged to start blog websites in their first year, so Jess and I took the chance to
                    exchange
                    and
                    critique each other's work. Jess is an impressive writer for someone who dislikes reading. It
                    still
                    confounds me that many aspiring journalists are so averse to reading books, biographies, or even
                    the
                    news, despite it being a core part of their profession. Nevertheless, Jess clearly falls into
                    that
                    small
                    percentage of people who possess a natural talent for writing.

                <p><em>It's Christmas! </em>Officially and unequivocally. Dust off that Mariah Carey EP, get Love

                    on, make sure to have a bucket of water balloons next to the door in case the carol singers come

                    The
                    Christmas lights got switched on in town last week (in November, I know!) and the Tree’s already
                    been
                    decorated and lit up under the town clock. As for me, it’s hard to get into the Christmas spirit
                    when
                    I’m expecting a fair amount of work to be dropped on me in the coming days. However, for today,
                    it’s
                    a

                <p>
                    I got complimented on my style today. From a fashion student too so that lends some credence to
                    their
                    opinions do you think?
                    <br><br>
                    I was in the pub for the majority of the day. First watching the Boro dispatch Hull and then the
                    three
                    o’clock kickoffs followed by the Formula One qualifying. I was bouncing between three groups of
                    friends
                    all afternoon. Mehmet and his Turkish friends all have a strong predilection for Arsenal for
                    some
                    reason
                    so they were in jovial spirits when Arsenal scored their fourth. A little bit of trepidation
                    crept
                    into
                    their voices when West Ham decided to stage a daring comeback but the overall result remained
                    firmly
                    in
                    Arsenal’s favour.
                    <br><br>
                    The F1 qualifying was disappointing with Verstappen taking pole. Out of the twenty DMU Racers
                    that
                    turned up to the pub, not one supported Red Bull. More than half are Mercedes or McLaren fans.
                    We’ve
                    got
                    some French students supporting Alpine, a few Germans supporting Sauber and one Italian cheering
                    for
                    Ferrari. But not one Red Bull supporter in the house. The season is all but over with only the
                    constructors title still left to compete for but the general apathy is starting to take hold. We
                    headed
                    over to the pool tables, where I managed to win a few free drinks off the lads - naturally, my
                    snooker
                    endowments came in handy. It’s a shame I don’t drink so instead I just took their cash. Always a
                    pleasure, lads.

                <p>
                    After a long day yesterday, I was in for an even longer day today. The new module - Software
                    Development
                    Methods & Standards - is as byzantine as it sounds. Each teacher has a different pedology style
                    which
                    makes the overall structure of the course unnecessarily complex. It would be a prodigious help
                    if we
                    were given clear instructions on the assessment from an early stage instead of keeping us in the
                    dark
                    until they find it prudent to spring it on us. The schedule has us attending one lecture a week
                    and
                    three two-hour seminars. This is problematic in itself because seminars are not recorded, nor
                    are
                    the
                    powerpoints uploaded for further revision (because most of the time it’s just a discussion and
                    not
                    anything worth creating a presentation for).
                    <br><br>
                    A module that solely relies on students attending petrifies me because how are we supposed to
                    revise
                    for
                    the inevitable phase test at the end. Are we going to be quizzed on questions that we’ve spoken
                    about in
                    the seminars or is the module leader going to ask us to do a presentation of our own? I’m at the
                    end
                    of
                    the first week out of seven and this module is proving to be more enigmatic than a <em>Sherlock
                    Holmes</em> tale.
                    <br><br>
                    I did my radio slot producing another banger of a show; further developing my nascent knowledge
                    of
                    the
                    broadcasting world. It may be superficial based on my projected career path but it brings me
                    great
                    pleasure sitting in that booth controlling the station with only myself responsible each week.
                    Also,
                    I
                    found out why Ghost has given herself/himself that particular nickname. She/he was oddly overt
                    with
                    sharing it. When she/he committed suicide in 2019, she/he thought she/he saw herself/himself as
                    an
                    apparition. It may have been an outer body experience or just a deluge of chemicals flooding the
                    brain
                    but she/he was adamant in her/his belief. Since then she/he is now living vicariously through
                    this
                    ethereal spirit. I wonder if she/he saw herself/himself as the opposite gender which is why
                    referring to
                    her/him now takes twice as long. Nevertheless, this is the fourth person to openly express their
                    suicidal tendencies to the group.
                    <br><br>
                    The Health and Wellbeing role in each society is normally a nominal position; there to satisfy
                    the
                    universities inclusion and acceptance policies but in Demon Media, it should be a full-time
                    position.
                    Somewhat ironically, he’s taken the past two weeks off because he’s got anxiety and depression
                    himself…

                <h2>Thursday, 28th November</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m off to London. Again. And similar to last time I am up and down in a day. Just a brief
                    sojourn
                    to
                    break up the monotony of coding and writing. So what was the purpose this time? Well I’m seeing
                    a
                    play.
                    <em>The play’s the thing.</em> But surprisingly it’s not Shakespeare on this occasion. <em>The
                    Duchess</em> starring Jodie Whittaker has been on my wishlist for some time and with the current
                    run
                    coming to an end next month, I needed to schedule an impromptu trip to see it.
                    <br><br>
                    I had no preconceived notions since I hadn’t read it but my English Literature friends hold it
                    in
                    high
                    regard. I thought I had a good grasp of things after the first half. A comedic love story
                    similar to
                    that of Romeo and Juliet. The Duchess is recalcitrant of her brothers so she chooses to marry
                    one of
                    her
                    stewards shortly after becoming a widow. Once the brothers find out, the Steward has to flee
                    with
                    their
                    two young children. After the intermission, I think John Webster had too much hopped beer.
                    Torture,
                    murder, perfidy. A rapid change of tone compared to the light-hearted merriment of the first
                    half.
                    Heart
                    wrenching throughout but unnecessarily graphic at certain points. Seeing the projection of the
                    Duchess’
                    husband and son being shot repeatedly on a loop on the white backdrop of the stage was more like
                    torture
                    for the audience instead of for the Duchess.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I was impressed with the play. It was good but I couldn’t help but feel that it could
                    have
                    been
                    great had it not been for the modern revisions to adapt it from the original. The random musical
                    interludes by a spectre dressed in white, (I assume she was supposed to depict an angel watching
                    over
                    the Duchess after she was murdered), slowed the pace down monumentally. The comedy aspects could
                    be
                    removed too as it’s supposed to be a grievous revenge tragedy. The dialogue with the English
                    Literature
                    students behind me agreed with this notion seeing they weren’t overly impressed with the modern
                    revisions. Mainly the superfluous swearing. It had a contrary effect rather than the intense
                    earnestness
                    that was intended.
                    <br><br>
                    After <em>The Duchess</em>, I headed over to the Apollo Theatre for <em>Fawlty Towers - The
                    Play</em>.
                    Again, I didn’t do any research into the play but as I’d seen the TV show, I figured it would be
                    a
                    continuation of the story with Basil, Cybil and Polly. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed.
                    It
                    was
                    just a round-up of the greatest hits. It was a two hour performance and in the first five
                    minutes
                    we’ve
                    been told to expect the hotel inspectors, Cybils ingrown toenail, the Germans and that pesky
                    moose.
                    Expectedly, Mrs Richardson made an appearance along with a poor facsimile of Bernnie Cribbins’
                    Mr
                    Hutchinson character.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m sure it’s a fan favourite and the audience were laughing at the jokes but I was
                    contemplating
                    leaving at the interval. I knew what was coming up and many of the scenes were rushed in order
                    to
                    cram
                    in as many storylines as possible. It was a great rendition of the Basil Fawlty character,
                    culminating
                    with the hilarious sketch with the Germans, but ultimately, I feel like this was an evening
                    wasted.
                    I
                    would have been much better suited watching <em>The Mousetrap</em>. Even if it is just my own
                    expectations that have let me down on this occasion.

                <p>
                    It’s only taken me eleven months since becoming receptive to new films, but I’ve finally sat
                    down to
                    watch <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. About an hour in, I thought I might have
                    misinterpreted
                    its primary themes because it could almost be categorised as a comedy. McMurphy organising a
                    basketball
                    game with the Chief, standing under the net to block free throws, and casually walking up the
                    court
                    to
                    score points felt almost whimsical. Then there’s the scene of chartering the fishing boat with
                    eleven -
                    <em>err, doctors</em> - after stealing the school bus.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t until the final act that the darker realities of life in a mental hospital took center
                    stage.
                    Electric shock therapy is always depicted as a draconian measure, often portrayed as the stuff
                    of
                    nightmares. McMurphy’s character doesn’t seem to change after the first round, but the second
                    leaves
                    him
                    incapacitated. I also suspected Billy would commit suicide, though I anticipated it happening at
                    a
                    different point in the film.
                    <br><br>
                    If I were to do an analytical study on the reasons behind Billy’s actions, I’d arraign Nurse
                    Ratched
                    as
                    the cause. Her deep infatuation with power over her patients overwhelmed her duty to help them.
                    Despite
                    McMurphy’s tragic end, there’s a poetic symmetry in the Chief using McMurphy’s escape plan for
                    his
                    own
                    bid for freedom. Solid 9.5/10. Now, I just need to watch <em>The Shining</em> to complete the
                    Jack
                    Nicholson trifecta from the New Hollywood era. Who would have thought I’d end up watching a
                    French
                    film
                    before <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>?

                    I got my mark back from the case analysis that I submitted almost a month ago. 90%. Good I’m a
                    good
                    writer. My skill with the quill is undeniable, and my lectures just can’t get enough of my

                    I
                    won’t cover and multiple subjects which I will be repeating. Not ideal in terms of learning but

                    I swifty headed to the radio studios to sort out the show for Friday night. Jamie’s very
                    laissez-faire,
                    meaning that he allows me to sort the running order and the timings out. After two years of
                    producing
                    his own <em>New Music Medley</em> show on Friday nights, I think he’s appreciative of my

                <h2>Monday, 25th November</h2>
                <p>
                    I watched a foreign film today. <em>Belle de Jour</em>. As you might have guessed, it’s French.
                    But
                    honestly, I think I would have found it just as confusing if it was in English. It’s about a
                    woman
                    who’s
                    unfulfilled in her marriage and has a penchant for sadomasochism. To satisfy her fantasies, she
                    spends
                    her afternoons in a brothel which she enjoys but her secret is exposed when one of her clients
                    is
                    friends with her husband. What confused me about the film was trying to discern what was real
                    and
                    what
                    was a dream. The first scene shows Belle getting carried off into the woods where she is whipped
                    after
                    her husband finds out about her infidelity. This would make sense to the story but is
                    inconsistent
                    with
                    the ending (which was also premature! I was expecting another ten minutes to complete the
                    denouement.)
                    The ending has Belle’s husband convalescing from being shot by an infatuated client but then in
                    the
                    same
                    scene, the paralysed husband gets up and hugs Belle. AND THEN IT ENDS.
                    <br><br>
                    EXPLAIN IT.
                    <br><br>
                    PLEASE.
                    <br><br>
                    It is still a good film but what could have made it better was the clear distinction of what was
                    real
                    and what was fictitious. There weren’t any clever camera angles or incorporeal jingles which
                    told us
                    when Belle was in a reverie so it’s up to the audience to figure it out. Reading up on the film,
                    this is
                    the director’s modus operandi which is why his is so revered in the surrealist film genre. My
                    brain
                    hurts. Perhaps, I better stick to <em>Film Noir</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    After banging my head against a wall several times, trying to decipher the film, I headed to the
                    radio
                    station to do a four hour stint, producing. It wasn’t supposed to be double-bubble but after I
                    did
                    the
                    first two hour slot with Jamie, I was beseeched by the Station Manager to produce the next show
                    because
                    the host was struggling with the dual-roles of presenter and producer. I have to say I agree
                    with
                    Angel’s opinion because Lantern, yes that’s really her name, (his name?) kept pressing the wrong
                    buttons
                    and erroneously assuming her mic was off when it wasn’t. The nadir of her show was when
                    she/he/they
                    swore twice and accidentally turned the sound mixer off resulting in dead-air for thirty
                    seconds.
                    And
                    that was all in the first five minutes. <em>Amateur</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Just to top this off, she/he/they also has crippling anxiety therefore proceeded to have a panic
                    attack
                    whilst I’m trying to sort the mixing desk out. I think the Station manager foresaw this which is
                    why
                    she
                    disappeared as soon as I stepped back into the studio. For those who were listening, they were
                    probably
                    wondering why a series of tracks from <em>The Jam, Madness</em> and <em>The Killers</em> filled
                    the
                    airways during a Musical Medley show. Really, I could do a show without a presenter and just
                    play
                    consecutive songs for an hour. It’ll give me valuable time to play with the technology and gain
                    a
                    little
                    more experience. Unfortunately the software we use is only available in the studios so we can’t
                    prepare
                    shows on our laptops. I’ve spoken to Ian who is the Radio station technician and he agrees with
                    my
                    inference that is more annoying than it is practical but he can’t do anything to address this. I
                    suggested virtualisation or using VMs, (surprisingly, he knew what these terms meant without me
                    explaining them) but he stopped me in my tracks. He explained the limitations that have plagued
                    the
                    student Radio station for years and touched on the infinitesimal resources he was operating
                    with. I
                    think his explanation was more meretricious than forthright; giving a bit of flim-flam to stop
                    me
                    from
                    asking more questions. Either way, it just gives me an excuse to spend more time in the studio
                    rather
                    than on my own.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, Mother made me send her back my Christmas money, probably because of all the talk about
                    MacBooks
                    on Saturday. I imagine she thinks I’m profligate and going to waste my money on something like
                    that…

                <p>
                    The Las Vegas Grand Prix kicked off at 6 a.m. UK time, which meant setting my alarm for the
                    ungodly
                    hour
                    of 5:30am. Why? To catch Martin Brundle’s iconic grid walk, of course. Predictably, anyone with
                    even
                    a
                    whiff of fame descended on the event, desperate to attach their names to this glittering
                    spectacle.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me be clear: I’m still not a fan of this race being on the F1 calendar. The U.S. already
                    boasts
                    races in Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. Meanwhile, countries like those in Africa are
                    campaigning
                    for their shot at hosting a Grand Prix, only to be sidelined in favour of Vegas’s flashy appeal.
                    In
                    any
                    other GP weekend, the race itself is the main event. But here in Las Vegas? It feels more like
                    an
                    accessory to the pomp and pageantry.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Rant over.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    On to the race: George Russell dominated from start to finish, with Lewis Hamilton close behind,
                    making
                    it a stellar weekend for Mercedes and British fans. But, as expected, Max Verstappen clinched
                    the
                    Drivers' Championship, which, let’s be honest, was always a foregone conclusion. Still,
                    Verstappen’s
                    triumph somewhat dims the glow of what was otherwise a fantastic result for the Britons.
                    <br><br>
                    The race wrapped up by 7:45am. I was out running by 8am. Finished eating my eggs for breakfast
                    by 9.
                    Then found myself bored with nothing left to do until Super Sunday rolled around.

                    I find myself in desperate need of a new laptop - though "new" doesn't quite capture the full
                    scope
                    of
                    what I'm after. No, I need an upgrade. The truth is, I go through laptops with the same
                    recklessness
                    as
                    Henry Fonda did marriages. Three laptops in three years at university - each succumbing to some
                    form
                    of
                    untimely demise, and all entirely beyond my control. One, tragically, met its end when it was
                    inadvertently sat upon by a Swedish commuter on the metro. But I digress.

                    As I approach the more demanding stages of my degree, my laptop has become the critical tool for
                    running
                    heavy-duty software: web servers, virtual machines, Android emulators. These resource-intensive
                    applications tax my system’s capabilities to their limit, causing frequent crashes, draining
                    battery
                    life, and putting my laptop through a ceaseless grind.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve always avoided MacBooks, primarily due to their inflated price tags. After all, the same
                    specs
                    on a
                    Lenovo can be found for a good £400 less than the equivalent MacBook. That said, I can no longer
                    ignore
                    the reality: Macs are built to run exactly the type of resource-hungry programs I use on a daily
                    basis,
                    making them far more efficient than my current setup. Beyond that, having a Mac would eliminate
                    the
                    frustration of juggling between operating systems. I currently run both Windows and Linux to
                    accommodate
                    different software needs, which forces me into a constant, time-consuming switch. Take, for
                    example,
                    the
                    Adobe Suite that I use for audio editing and Photoshop that are only supported by Windows.
                    Conversely, I
                    prefer Linux because coding is infinitely more manageable, thanks to its seamless access to the
                    terminal.
                    <br><br>
                    MacBooks, in contrast, strike the balance of compatibility across all these applications, as
                    they’re
                    widely used and universally supported. But here’s the catch: despite all their merits, there is
                    simply
                    no way I’m justifying a £1500 laptop purchase when I’m down to only six months left at
                    university. I
                    should have invested in one three years ago instead of buying the gaming laptop which I
                    subsequently
                    sold…

                <p>
                    Last week, I suspected my flatmates of being thieves. Today, I uncovered the truth. It wasn't
                    the
                    teenagers, Esther or Summer - no, the culprit is Marvin, the 30-year-old man. He's the one who’s
                    been
                    taking my cutlery. If you want to use them, fine - let’s share. Use it, wash it, and put it
                    back,
                    simple. But let’s not start taking each other’s things and claiming them as our own, stashing
                    them
                    in
                    our own cupboards. I did ask him about it, and instead of denying it, his response was so
                    baffling
                    that
                    I can only describe it as resembling the behaviour of someone with dementia - he seemed to have
                    no
                    recollection of ever using any cutlery whatsoever. <em>Sigh</em>. I suppose this is the game
                    we’re
                    playing now. I really don’t want to start storing kitchen utensils in my room but that might be
                    the
                    only
                    thing left to do if this thievery persists, especially after I’ve confronted him.
                    <br><br>
                    A quick update: You remember the review I wrote for Dalia, reflecting on my year in Stockholm?
                    Well,
                    one
                    of the three questions I answered has now been published. To recap, the task was to provide
                    advice
                    we
                    wish we had received before, during, and after our Erasmus year. My section, which focused on
                    advice
                    for
                    the pre-Erasmus phase, has been published - but not without considerable censorship, which I
                    strongly
                    suspect was carried out by Dalia herself.
                    <br><br>
                    There is not a single issue mentioned - no culture shock, no visa delays, no difficulties of any
                    kind.
                    The reviews paint an entirely unrealistic picture, suggesting that Erasmus students simply
                    choose
                    their
                    destination, board a plane, are met with open arms, make an abundance of new friends, accumulate
                    boundless experience, and leave with perfect exam scores, longing for another year abroad. This
                    is
                    not
                    an embellishment; it is outright mendacity.
                    <br><br>
                    Had Dalia desired only uncritical, positive feedback, she should have made that explicit from
                    the
                    outset. Instead, she used the ‘tailor it to your own experience’ spiel knowing unequivocally
                    that
                    not
                    everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows. It just feels somewhat deceptive, especially
                    given
                    that all the reviews follow the same script now. Overt advertisements for the Erasmus program
                    instead of
                    genuine, nuanced reflections from the participants.

                <p>
                    I slept in this morning; something I’ve not been able to do in the two months since I moved in
                    due
                    to
                    the uncooperative spring placement which sticks me in the side when I roll over. However
                    yesterday,
                    after a flip and a twist, all is well again. It’s not the first time it’s been flipped as
                    evidenced
                    by
                    the stain in one corner, nevertheless, it clearly is more comfortable after the ten hours of
                    uninterrupted sleep I’ve had.
                    <br><br>
                    It is the fourth day of the holidays and I have not been as productive as I would have liked,
                    though
                    not
                    for lack of trying. I’ve been sociable and I have been coding but I haven’t achieved the
                    projects
                    which
                    I noted on my to-do list last weekend. Debugging, as always, is a Sisyphean task: hours of work,
                    oceans
                    of frustration, and at the end of it all, my boulder is right back at the bottom of the hill.

                        you Stephen Fry for the lessons in Greek Mythology).</em>
                    <br><br>
                    In dire need of a break, I caught up with Natalia at her flat this afternoon. Not Polish Natalia
                    -
                    well,
                    yes, Polish Natalia, but not <em>that</em> Polish Natalia. Not the one teaching me photography -
                    this is
                    Natalia who I’ve known the longest who’s a researcher. Natalia who knows campus gossip like the
                    back
                    of
                    her hand. You’d think graduating would loosen her grip on the pulse of university drama, but no.
                    Ostensibly, she is a teacher because her job title is researcher but really she’s sat in a lab
                    all
                    day.
                    Apparently, spending her days reading all the department emails which she’s cc’ed in on meaning
                    she’s
                    got the inside scoop on redundancies, departmental squabbles, and other staff grievances. It’s
                    not
                    exactly the scandal and intrigue in <em>His Girl Friday</em>, but it does offer a peek behind
                    the
                    academic velvet curtain.

                <p>
                    This evening marked a milestone: I produced my first solo radio show. Ghost was opposite me in
                    the
                    booth, presenting with her usual flair. (Why she insists on using a pseudonym remains a mystery.
                    I've
                    long since stopped trying to decipher the eccentricities of the media society - it’s an endless
                    rabbit
                    hole.) My role? Sound checks, monitoring levels, ensuring everything ran smoothly. And it was…
                    until
                    the
                    group chat erupted.
                    <br><br>
                    The messages started rolling in. All informing us that we were doing it wrong. In fact, that was
                    the
                    common threat of all their messages. Verbatim: ‘You are doing it wrong’. Lacks a certain
                    specificity
                    don’t you think. What? What is wrong? Tell me. The feed? Interference? A rogue cable? A meteor
                    striking
                    the studio? I wanted answers, but instead, I got a deluge of similarly unhelpful messages. It
                    felt
                    like
                    trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing. Still, I kept my cool and reassured
                    Ghost.
                    After
                    all, as the BBC speaker at last week’s talk so wisely put it: <em>“As producer, it’s your job to
                    smile
                    and wave, even if the sound mixer is ablaze.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    So, we soldiered on. Ghost was in her element, delivering a stellar show, while I maintained my
                    façade
                    of calm professionalism, inwardly unravelling the mystery of what’s gone wrong. Eventually,
                    Angel,
                    our
                    station manager (currently gallivanting on a DMUGlobal trip in Croatia), swooped into the chat
                    like
                    a
                    deus ex machina, ejecting the troublemakers. It turns out the culprits were a group of
                    disgruntled
                    former members; students who’d been ousted from the society for violating some nebulous rules.
                    From
                    what
                    I’ve gathered (a patchwork of whispered gossip and cryptic commentary from the board), their
                    bitterness
                    still festers.
                    <br><br>
                    With that drama resolved, the rest of the show ran like clockwork. Ghost dazzled, and I managed
                    to
                    keep
                    everything humming along. And now? I’m apparently in demand as a producer for Friday’s medley
                    show.
                    It
                    seems being a producer is prime real estate in the media society - everyone wants a show, but no
                    one
                    wants to tackle the tech. Hot commodity or not, tonight was a success. Drama, feedback loops,
                    and
                    all.

                <p>
                    I received my first email regarding the Paris trip happening in the spring next year. It looks
                    like
                    there will be nineteen people in total, eleven girls and six boys, excluding myself. I can’t
                    quite
                    figure out what it is that deters the lads from joining these kinds of trips. The same pattern
                    emerged
                    when I went to Bilbao in my first year, where only myself and two other guys went, compared to
                    the
                    twelve girls on that trip. Not that I mind. I ended up meeting two of my closest friends,
                    Natalia
                    and
                    Emily, on our visit to Spain. It’s easier to mingle in a group like that, especially when
                    everyone
                    is
                    intrepid enough to sign up for the experience in the first place. You can usually count on them
                    not
                    being the taciturn type.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon, I met Natalia to do a photography session. Not the same Natalia mentioned above,
                    this is
                    Polish Natalia. Wait, that doesn’t work, Natalia from Warsaw. Nope, that doesn’t either. Natalia
                    who
                    does film production, who I met a few weeks ago. Yep, that works. We’re going out with our
                    cameras
                    so
                    she can show me how to level up my photos. The first drops of snow were coming down and the
                    snowflakes
                    were large enough to see on camera, giving us a winter wonderland backdrop. After our session,
                    we
                    ended
                    up in a coffee shop with our laptops. Since she’s also got experience in sound editing and
                    photoshop,
                    she’s in the process of teaching me those skills too. Turning out to be a very prosperous
                    friendship.

                <p>
                    Since the first module is over and I finally have time to breathe again, I can better appreciate
                    the
                    subtle nuances I miss from Stockholm. The idiosyncrasies I had there, which once seemed so
                    inconsequential, are now uniquely tied to my experience in Sweden. Take, for instance, the
                    ritual of
                    reading my Kindle every day on the metro. I still read now - I've just finished Lord of the
                    Flies
                    (which, incidentally, has a fantastic ending) - but not with the same consistency or for the
                    same
                    length
                    of time as I did last year. The 45-minute uninterrupted journey from Kista to the Frescati
                    campus
                    offered the perfect opportunity to lose myself in a good book. These days, with my packed
                    schedule
                    of
                    extracurriculars, I seldom have the luxury of a spare hour.
                    <br><br>
                    The most obvious aspect of Stockholm I miss is its idyllic charm - the canals, Gamla Stan, the
                    royal
                    residence, and, of course, the meatballs. While I am more active and sociable in Leicester than
                    I
                    ever
                    was in Stockholm, that does not imply I disliked my solitude there. Long walks through the city
                    were
                    a
                    cherished routine - until the cold winter descended, at least.
                    <br><br>
                    Which brings me neatly to why I don’t entirely miss Stockholm. It was around this time last year
                    that
                    the plunging temperatures drove me indoors. I spent those months binge-watching Tom Baker’s
                    seasons
                    of
                    <em>Doctor Who</em>, venturing out only for groceries or weekends away to other European
                    capitals.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, for all I’m enjoying myself in Leicester, there remains something magical about my time in
                    Scandinavia - majestic, even. There was a quiet ostentation in being able to say, “I live in
                    Stockholm.”
                    It made people sit up and listen. Perhaps that’s what I miss most: the glamour, the sense of
                    reverence,
                    which Leicester, for all its merits, so conspicuously lacks.
                    <br><br>
                    It feels like I’ve been talking about Stockholm a lot recently. I’ve made a lot of new
                    acquaintances
                    through clubs and societies and one of my best anecdotes starts with ‘During my year in
                    Stockholm…’.
                    I’ve also been spending more time with Daria and a few of the other incoming exchange students
                    which
                    is
                    why Stockholm is constantly on my mind. They all want to see as much of Leicester as they can
                    whilst
                    they are here and expect me to give them tours. Unfortunately, my unadventurous first and second
                    years
                    have left me in the same position as them - wanting to explore a city I’ve never fully
                    discovered
                    myself. It’s a bit embarrassing, considering I’ve already lived here for two years.

                <p>
                    My module is finished and yet I still find myself in the basement of the library at quarter past
                    eight
                    on a Saturday morning. Why would anyone be in the library at that ungodly hour the day after the
                    exams?
                    Well, foolishly I left my keyboard in the Radio studio last night so I needed to hasten back to
                    get
                    it
                    before it was stolen. Seeing that I was on campus, I might as well start working whilst it’s
                    quiet.
                    I
                    have no official deadlines however there are certain topics and skills that I want to learn or
                    remind
                    myself of whilst I have some free time. It would have been a great revision session had it not
                    been
                    for
                    the open day tours disturbing me every fifteen minutes.

                <p>
                    All that preparation. The countless hours immersed in esoteric concepts, navigating the
                    labyrinth of
                    Big
                    Data and AI. All those efforts distilled into a multiple-choice quiz that was over in a mere
                    five
                    minutes. 18 out of 20. With 80% of the module now complete, I’ve already secured more than
                    enough to
                    clinch a first. And that’s without factoring in the case analysis, still pending evaluation.
                    <br><br>
                    A year ago, I was grappling with essay-style answers for each question in my exams, assessments
                    stretching to four-hour marathons. Now, I’m breezing through quizzes tied to a single lecture
                    from
                    just
                    two weeks prior. I can't complain - I've learned plenty. Yet, the stark contrast between the two
                    systems
                    is striking, almost unsettling. And this, despite the UK’s standing as a global paragon of
                    education.
                    With the module behind me, a week of respite awaits. It’s important I use this time effectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Like spending it in the radio studio. Friday nights are the Demon FM meetings where we are
                    learning
                    the
                    inner-workings of the mixer desk and the software. Tonight was a small gathering since it is the
                    final
                    day of the module and most people are getting their coursework finished by the midnight
                    deadline. It
                    gave me more time on the decks and the Zetta network. It’s a lot to take in but rather intuitive
                    therefore I’m confident that I’ll be able to pick it up. Producing sounds like a nice gig. I
                    don’t
                    need
                    to be on the microphones and I can control everything from behind the sound desk. Sounds like a
                    perfect
                    job. However that means it’s down to me to be trigger-ready on the mute buttons if I think a
                    swear
                    is
                    coming. Ofcom takes that sort of stuff seriously, <em>apparently</em>.

                <p>
                    Another day of revision. I am dedicating most of my days to the exam I have tomorrow. I have
                    been a
                    regular in the library and have been recapping everything. Rather superfluously, I should add
                    since
                    I
                    only need a paltry five correct answers out of twenty to achieve my 70% target overall.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, I also received another delightful email from DMUGlobal - their messages seem to be the
                    highlight
                    of my inbox. In case I haven’t mentioned, I’ll be heading to Paris in April. Exciting huh. Just
                    days
                    after my participation was confirmed, I was invited to apply for additional funding. Normally,
                    I’d
                    overlook such an offer, given that I come from a comfortably low-middle-class background. But to
                    my
                    surprise, I actually meet three out of the six eligibility criteria. Traditionally, funding has
                    been
                    more targeted at students from BAME backgrounds or low-income neighbourhoods. However, DMU seems
                    to
                    be
                    broadening its criteria, recognising that support should extend to a wider range of
                    demographics.
                    They
                    now consider factors like parents' educational background, status as a mature student, or
                    whether
                    one
                    comes from an economically challenged postcode. Thanks to these adjustments, I qualify for an
                    extra
                    £200
                    in funding, meaning that my trip to Paris will cost me only £25 in total. Propitiously, I didn’t
                    even
                    need to resort to the usual tactics of persuasion or subtle manipulation that I sometimes rely
                    on
                    advertising my harrowing cleft palate condition.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, the cutlery thief has struck again. This is ridiculous.

                    100% in the coursework - a personal record for me. In Stockholm when I needed to present, I
                    always
                    found
                    it daunting and intimidating. Even if the code worked and had no issues, my grade rested on
                    whether
                    I
                    could persuade the lecturer, who I’d barely spoken to, of its authenticity. This morning was
                    different
                    though. I had Dilan next to me and Osama is a much gentler figure than the weight-lifting,
                    ex-wrestling,
                    former-female heavyweight Swedish boxing champion, Beatrice Acklebloom who was my programming
                    professor
                    in Stockholm. (Quite a resume she’s got too!) I now only have the phase test on Friday and then
                    that’s
                    the module over. Because of how it’s weighted, I only need 15% in the exam to end the module
                    with a
                    first. Quite a result given my apathy for Mobile App Development.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon, I attended a careers day hosted by the BBC, this time focused on opportunities
                    in
                    radio
                    for students. Although radio isn’t exactly my field, the event still resonated with the
                    professional
                    paths I’m exploring - and it's not every day the Beeb comes to town! I’m keeping my options
                    open,
                    but
                    I’m still uncertain about what I want to pursue after graduation. Data analysis, web
                    development,
                    media
                    production, writing... so many choices and so little time.

                <h2>Tuesday, 12th November</h2>
                <p>
                    Tonight was Hackers Society’s game night - a chance for everyone to head to Firebug, unwind,
                    enjoy
                    some
                    classic pub-grub, and dive into a lineup of games. No hacking, coding, or tech talk, just pure
                    fun.
                    We
                    played chess, Uno, Cards Against Humanity, Mario Kart, and Wii Sports. Honestly, it felt like a
                    ten-year-old's birthday party, and I loved every minute of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the crowd already knew each other from last year’s society, so they had a good sense of
                    who
                    to
                    avoid in chess. Given that everyone here is either a Computer Science or Cyber Security major -
                    and,
                    let’s just say, equipped with a distinctly analytical mindset - I assumed they’d all be like
                    Magnus
                    Carlsen on the chessboard. Feeling somewhat emboldened from my victory against a first year, I
                    challenged Jack, the reigning Hackers champion. His reputation clearly preceded him, as no one
                    else
                    seemed willing to take him on.
                    <br><br>
                    We sat down, and the game was afoot. Twenty-five minutes later, I had him checkmated. Turns out,
                    what I
                    have can’t be taught. I am inimitable… As I declared checkmate, a collective “ooo” resonated
                    across
                    the
                    room. There’s a new sheriff in town, folks.
                    <br><br>
                    The night continued, and I was in high spirits, still riding the thrill of my chess victory.
                    Soon,
                    <em>Trivial
                        Pursuit</em> made an appearance. Although my knowledge of general world trivia is iffy at
                    best,
                    it
                    didn’t seem to matter with the usual barrage of obscure questions. Then, a twist of fate: <em>Doctor
                    Who
                    Trivial Pursuit</em>. Apparently, Hackers Society could just as easily be a Whovian club, as
                    everyone
                    around the table turned out to be die-hard fans. Now I was genuinely excited.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting among Doctor Who enthusiasts, exchanging theories, dissecting episodes, actors,
                    storylines,
                    plot
                    twists, and character arcs, was a dream come true. Honestly, this group might even be more
                    dedicated
                    than the official Doctor Who Society (who, I suspect, may be more about cosplay and waving
                    around
                    sonic
                    screwdrivers). All those hours I spent on IMDb were about to pay off. And although the
                    competition
                    was
                    friendly, just as I’d seized Jack’s chess crown, I now had my sights on Emma’s <em>Doctor Who
                    Trivial
                    Pursuit</em> title. “You can name all of Season One’s episodes? That’s great! I can name them
                    all,”
                    I
                    said, trying to sound casual, though I probably didn’t pull it off.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I knew it, I was put to the test, rattling off all 178 episodes since the 2005 reboot.
                    When I
                    finished, everyone chipped in to pay for my meal. Finally, some recognition for all those hours
                    spent
                    rewatching and researching.
                    <br><br>
                    The game only intensified, with more arcane Doctor Who trivia - details I’d picked up after my
                    twentieth
                    rewatch of certain episodes or while researching actors, Murray Gold’s scores, and writers on
                    IMDb.
                    There were even some classic Who questions, which I aced, thanks to binge-watching Tom Baker’s
                    seasons
                    while in Stockholm. If I hadn’t discovered film noir back in January, I’d probably still be
                    working
                    my
                    way through Sylvester McCoy’s episodes by now. I suppose I have Humphrey Bogart and Orson Welles
                    to
                    thank for interrupting my Whovian marathon.
                    <br><br>
                    So naturally, I won Trivial Pursuit too, securing a newfound respect from my fellow Hackers.
                    King of
                    the
                    Nerds, undisputed. I imagine this is how Sam Spade must have felt after cracking the Maltese
                    Falcon
                    case
                    - cool, confident, and holding all the cards. Only in my case, the cards were Doctor Who trivia
                    and
                    Uno.
                    As I walked out of Firebug, I just needed a thick fog to roll in, a flickering street lamp, and
                    some
                    jazz playing in the background - just a detective wrapping up another case, leaving a trail of
                    awestruck
                    witnesses in my wake.<em>“That’s the stuff that dreams are made of.”</em>

                    You may remember I wrote a detailed account delineating the highs and lows of my erasmus year
                    and
                    presented it in <a href="#Nov4">the form of advice</a>. Well, today I checked the Padlet page

                    the entries were
                    submitted and, alas, mine has been omitted entirely, even after my revisions to align it with

                    university’s tone. Sometimes the truth is raw, unpolished and not always what we expected, but
                    nevertheless, veracity should be rewarded instead of these congruent narratives which everyone
                    is
                    peddling. So that annoyed me more than it probably should have. Particularly, taking into
                    account
                    the
                    hours it took me to write all three sections comprehensively.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, closer to home, it appears a thief walks among us. I began the year with three of each
                    utensil, yet now I’m down to a single knife, two spoons, and two forks. One item gone could be
                    an
                    accident, a simple misplacement. But this - this is a pattern. There’s no other explanation. I’m
                    sharing
                    a space with a cutlery thief. When I catch them in the act, well... let’s just say they may find
                    themselves on the wrong end of my remaining knife.

                <p>
                    That’s it. I’ve completely finished the coursework section of the course. Submitted the
                    application
                    in
                    conjunction with the 4500-word report I hammered out today. It only took eleven hours, but
                    what’s
                    time
                    but just a man-made construct to measure the days we’ve passed and... the days we have left, I
                    guess?
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I am both exhausted and, strangely, a little wired. 4500 words.
                    Four-thousand-five-hundred
                    words. That’s like… a short novella or a marathon in word form. Or is it? I don’t even know what
                    constitutes "a lot of words" anymore because my brain has been processing ideas for so long that
                    everything just looks like text and deadlines. Maybe I should submit my report for my writers
                    room
                    submission? See how much fun they have learning about Mobile App Development. It’s funny
                    because,
                    for
                    the past few hours, I’ve been this mad typing machine, like my fingers were on autopilot. I’m
                    not
                    even
                    sure if all of it makes sense, but here’s hoping coherence stuck around through the sleep
                    deprivation.
                    <br><br>
                    And now that it’s done, I feel this weird mix of accomplishment and aimlessness. Like, what am I
                    supposed to do with myself now? I’ve been planning and stressing over this coursework for so
                    long
                    that
                    it’s like I’ve forgotten how to not be working on it. Should I take a nap? Binge something
                    mindless?
                    Or
                    should I just... sit here and stare at a wall, you know, contemplate existence and how words
                    like
                    “4500”
                    and “done” feel good but, like, also anticlimactic? Because that’s where I’m at. I guess I’ll
                    just
                    go to
                    bed…

                <p>
                    Got my first job interview scheduled. One of the companies who attended the Careers event that I
                    mentioned on Thursday are holding interviews the week commencing the 18th. I was aware that they
                    were
                    hiring one person to complete a six week summer internship exclusively from DMU so I guess
                    everyone
                    got
                    an email saying the same thing. I know it’s inconsequential but it annoys me when the career
                    advisor
                    starts the email with ‘Congratulations, you’ve been selected to interview …” intentionally
                    making it
                    sound like it was just a handful of us when in reality, everyone who signed up got an
                    opportunity to
                    interview. On the day, I even mentioned to the session leader that I had no experience using the
                    tech
                    stack which they use so I don’t exactly think that it will be a propitious interview. I guess I
                    can
                    go
                    and talk about the broader concepts of Web Development and if I get past the first hurdle, I can
                    learn
                    the coding side of the job over Christmas. It’ll be good interview practice regardless.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, that coursework which I’ve been doing for the past fortnight is due on Monday at 10am in
                    conjunction with a report detailing the different components of the app and explaining the
                    functionality. The latter part of the assignment completely slipped my mind. It’s 10pm on a
                    Saturday
                    night so tomorrow is going to be a busy day writing up everything which we’ve built over the
                    past
                    two
                    weeks. Oh my favourite day of the week, soured by the incessant bore of coursework…

                <p>
                    I submitted my first submission for the Demon Media magazine today. The deadline is Monday.
                    Because
                    of
                    the vast interest in writing, the editor-in-chief has decided to limit the submission to one
                    article
                    per
                    person for now. As we move into the second half of the year, it is expected the interest will
                    subside
                    and I’ll be able to write a few more per edition. The theme is Winter/Christmas so I wrote an
                    anodyne
                    piece on the top ten films to rewatch this year. I’ve included the classics and even snuck in
                    The
                    Bishop’s Wife in the honourable mentions section.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m still interested in taking over the website but I keep getting shrugged off by the head of
                    the
                    Media
                    society. The new website was expected ‘imminently’ however that was over a month ago and still
                    no
                    new
                    website. I’m at the point where I’m almost sure they are going to keep the same webpage but
                    change
                    the
                    stylesheet associated with it. That will satisfy their definition of updating it. Until this
                    happens
                    though, I’m going to keep badgering them.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening I was attending the Demon FM workshop for the new intake of participants. As I’m
                    writing
                    this, I’ve just realised that today has been all Demon Media. Either writing for the magazine,
                    editing
                    or production training. As I have no intention of doing a radio show - my interest lies in the
                    software
                    and hardware - my services have been offered to anyone who needs them. Normally the people who
                    are
                    planning their own shows but don’t have the technical know-how to set up the equipment or
                    operate
                    the
                    program we use. From what I can see, it is an intuitive system for beginners so it looks like
                    I’ll
                    be in
                    high demand when the new schedule kicks off after Christmas for the new shows going on air.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, a bit of a digression; a student arrived on campus wearing a MAGA cap and began openly
                    endorsing
                    some of Trump’s more controversial policies. The situation quickly escalated. By the time campus
                    security showed up, the student had a black eye, and there was blood on the pavement. It’ll be
                    interesting to see how the university addresses this incident. There was clear provocation, but
                    the
                    university’s commitment to maintaining a safe, inclusive environment may take precedence over
                    assigning
                    blame. It seems likely they’ll aim to address the incident through the lens of campus safety
                    rather
                    than
                    dissecting the motivations behind it.

                    DMU Hackers is really starting to heat up. We’ve finally shed the dead weight—the people who
                    only
                    showed
                    up for something to add to their CV. Now, we’re diving into more serious topics, like network
                    attacks
                    and Linux machine vulnerabilities. Although I’m studying Computer Science, I wouldn’t label
                    myself a
                    “hacker.” In IT speak, I’m more of a “coder” within the software development side of things, so
                    I
                    was

                    to a
                    few employers, including companies in the same circles as JLR and Peregrine. Remember that

                    CV
                    has been making the rounds. I’m not entirely sure I authorised this sharing, but if it leads to
                    a
                    graduate position, I might just let the data privacy concerns slide as part of the deal.

                    Celebrations, the coursework is finished. 18:34 to mark the exact time. Dilan and I did a nine
                    hour
                    coding session today to hammer it out. Of course, all of my commits were done under Dilan’s
                    scrupulous
                    supervision. I would like to say that it was a fifty-fifty split of the workload but that would
                    be
                    disingenuous. Actually, when we come to present out application on Monday to our lecturer, that
                    is
                    exactly what I’ll be saying but given the enormity of the transgression I made yesterday, (Dilan
                    spent
                    much of the day and last night rectifying that mistake whilst I was out enjoying myself at
                    Loftus
                    Road),
                    Dilan completed most of the back-end functionality, adapters, list views, database links and
                    error
                    checks. What did I do, you might ask. Well, I made it look nice and the User Interface is the
                    most
                    important part wouldn’t you say? To put it another way: if we were building a car, Dilan had
                    built
                    the
                    engine, chassis, suspension, electrics and transmission, but I turned it from a Mini Cooper into
                    a
                    Lamborghini. I feel like I need a lie down. Dilan’s going straight to bed. I suppose he’s
                    deserved
                    it
                    after staying up most of the night fixing my errors. Did I mention he’s also got a cold? Poor
                    lad.

                    As the coursework deadline day looms ominously on the horizon, Dilan and I have been tearing
                    through
                    our
                    coursework like a bull on steroids. We’re implementing features that are so far beyond the
                    design
                    specification that they practically require their own postcode. We’re the dream team. Inimitable
                    and
                    original. We don’t just aim for the stars; we’re trying to lasso a comet. (Thank you Mehmet for
                    that
                    poetic metaphor). Our work was cruising along like a well-oiled machine, until, in a moment of
                    utter
                    brilliance (or perhaps sheer lunacy), I decided to upload a piece of faulty code. You know, the
                    kind
                    of
                    code that makes even the most forgiving compiler throw up its virtual hands in despair.
                    <br><br>
                    To put this into perspective for you non-techies, imagine you’re Mr Blandings, meticulously
                    planning
                    your dream home. You’ve got the blueprints all sorted, the silk drapes ordered, and the crystal
                    countertops sparkling. Everything’s perfect until I waltz in, muddy boots and all, armed with a
                    sledgehammer and a questionable sense of architectural integrity. One swing, and suddenly,
                    you’re
                    not
                    standing on your dream oasis anymore. That’s right, I turned your dream house into a pile of
                    rubble
                    faster than you can say “renovation nightmare.” You’re shaking your head in disbelief; standing
                    in
                    the
                    ruins of what was once your tranquil paradise, now reduced to a chaotic mess of shattered dreams
                    and
                    splintered wood. That’s me right now. I broke it. Incorrigibly and irreparable. Like a toddler
                    with
                    a
                    crayon in a museum, I’ve left my mark all over our once-glorious project.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m watching Dilan descend into insanity as he tries to repair my handwork. What would make my
                    transgression even worse? Leaving at the pivotal moment to go to London to watch the Boro play.
                    I
                    guess
                    I’ve given Dilan something to do whilst I’m away. There’s the common saying that teamwork makes
                    the
                    dream work - unless one of the teammates is me … with a sledgehammer.

                    Today I received an email from Dalia, the DMU Global exchange officer in charge of preparing and
                    advising incoming and outgoing exchange students. Her primary role at the moment is persuading
                    current

                    last year's Erasmus alumni to write their thoughts and perspectives in a forum to show to

                    candidates. Questioning if I should talk about the fallacies of living abroad or the harsh
                    realities, I
                    settled on including some of the points I mentioned in last Wednesday’s blog; opting for
                    veracity
                    rather
                    than embellishment.
                    <br><br>
                    So, the email. I figured it was going to be a <em>‘It would be in your best interests to write
                    something
                    positive’</em> type of email after being overtly critical of certain things, but to my surprise,
                    Dalia
                    was actually quite pleased with the straightforwardness of my review. What she wasn’t so
                    thrilled
                    about,
                    however, was my laissez-faire attitude toward the law. Words like ‘fraudulent’ and ‘expedient’
                    made
                    their way into her critique.
                    <br><br>
                    She made it abundantly clear that the conclusion needed to be toned down to something more
                    anodyne,
                    something the university could stand behind without breaking a sweat. Specifically, she had a
                    problem
                    with my closing line: <em>“Remember, nothing’s illegal if you’re foreign.” </em>Apparently, this
                    isn’t
                    the kind of stance the university wants to be associated with. Go figure. What happened to
                    freedom
                    of
                    Speech? This used to be a respectable country.

                <h2>Sunday, 3nd November</h2>
                <p>
                    I love days like today. Absolutely love them. Mornings filled with coding and afternoons packed
                    with
                    football and Formula One. It’s a ritual I’ve followed for years, though the company has changed
                    over
                    time. Gone are the days when I’d lock myself in my room, tuning out the world. Now, I spend my
                    Sunday
                    afternoons at Soar Point – the social hub where sports and quizzes and everything society
                    related is
                    based.
                    <br><br>
                    The atmosphere here is electric on matchdays. When the DMU football teams gather, the three rows
                    of
                    tables are reserved giving us the best seats in the house. As expected, they’re a passionate
                    bunch,
                    all
                    fervently loyal to their team but there’s always room for humour. Honestly, it’s a miracle the
                    Man
                    Utd
                    fans keep coming back, given the relentless banter they endure every week. Also you may remember
                    I
                    handed in my resignation from the futsal team a few weeks ago. Well today, I’ve met my
                    replacement.
                    Aaron Smith from Cornwall. I couldn’t make it up. The white boy paragon: <em>indie music, The
                    Office,
                    crossfit, kitted out in North Face apparel, and overusing phrases like “oh my gosh”</em>. I’ll
                    let
                    you
                    make your own conclusions.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the football winds down, it’s time for classic pub grub - and not the bacteria on toast I
                    half-expect at some places. We’re talking juicy burgers, crispy chicken kievs, cheesy pizzas -
                    the
                    kind
                    of comfort food that even my picky appetite can’t resist.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the football fans clear out, the Karting and Racing societies flood in, eager to claim the
                    newly
                    vacated seats. The atmosphere stays just as charged, especially this week with the chaos of the
                    Brazilian Grand Prix. The unpredictable weather turned what should have been a straightforward
                    ninety-minute race into a two-and-a-half-hour epic, complete with cars spinning off track,
                    safety
                    car
                    interventions, and red flags galore.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the boys here are die-hard McLaren fans, and for them, Lando Norris is the local hero.
                    With
                    Norris starting on pole and Max Verstappen all the way down in seventeenth, it felt inevitable
                    that
                    the
                    gap in the Driver’s Championship standings would shrink to just 25 points. A thrilling prospect,
                    and
                    the
                    tension was palpable.
                    <br><br>
                    But in true Formula One fashion, everything unravelled. The McLaren strategy left everyone
                    frustrated,
                    and when Max pulled off the drive of his career to take the win, drinks went flying in
                    frustration,
                    a
                    spectacular show of collective disappointment. Yet, in the midst of all the drama, Alpine
                    quietly
                    secured an impressive second and third place. Not that anyone here really noticed—or cared, for
                    that
                    matter.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s it. Another perfect Sunday concluded. Admittedly, some weekends are better than
                    others
                    based
                    on external factors such as whether it was a successful week in Fantasy or if I’ve got a
                    headstart
                    on
                    the coming week's lectures. Nevertheless, today was a good day.

                <h2>Saturday, 2nd November</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s Bonfire Night. Normally not something I would go out of my way for however, a rare stroke
                    of
                    fortune had earned me a ticket. A little caveat of winning was the dubious pleasure of being a
                    chaperone
                    for the group of exchange students from all corners of the university. It seemed that fate (or,
                    in
                    more
                    practical terms, the raffle drum) had decreed I be here. Otherwise, I’d have been watching the
                    F1
                    qualifying and trying to complete my coursework so really this was a grand procrastination
                    excursion.
                    <br><br>
                    Daria, the perpetually cheerful Exchange Liaison who I met at the meeting on Wednesday, was
                    already
                    herding our diverse flock when I arrived. The group was eclectic, with students from various
                    faculties
                    and from all over the globe. I spoke to a large number of them about what drew them to Leicester
                    and
                    for
                    most, the answer was, they wanted to be in the UK - anywhere in the UK. A couple of them had
                    travelled
                    from Stockholm University, and in a twist of serendipity, they actually shared my general
                    cynicism
                    about
                    university administration. It was a relief, honestly. Usually, conversations in these settings
                    spiral
                    into small talk about weather, coursework, or travel itineraries, but here were people willing
                    to
                    engage
                    in what I’d call my “status quo grievances.” We had a lively discussion, which made the whole
                    affair
                    feel less forced. Shared disillusionment has a way of bringing people together, doesn’t it?
                    <br><br>
                    Bonfire Night was held in Abbey Park, but the whole event had morphed into something almost
                    unrecognisable from my childhood. I remember when this night was simpler: kids running around
                    with
                    sparklers, their eyes wide with wonder. Back then, it was a neighbourhood affair—a yearly ritual
                    where
                    community spirit briefly overshadowed everything else. Now, the event felt industrialised,
                    swallowed
                    up
                    by consumerism. A £30 entry fee for what was essentially an amusement park. Food trucks lined
                    the
                    area,
                    fairground rides rattled the ground beneath our feet, and LED-light wands were being sold to
                    eager
                    and
                    impressionable kids. A live band played on the periphery, adding to the spectacle. Thankfully, I
                    got
                    in
                    for free, because my frugal nature doesn’t consider this kind of extravagance a luxury worth
                    paying
                    for.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I made use of the situation. With my camera, I captured moments both mundane and magical.
                    The
                    bonfire itself, a towering inferno crackling against the night sky, made for some striking
                    shots.
                    Fireworks splintered into bursts of colour, and for a fleeting second, it almost made me forget
                    about
                    the looming coursework deadlines hanging over me. Almost. There were genuine moments of joy,
                    especially
                    among the exchange students, and I found myself appreciating the odd patch of laughter or the
                    sudden
                    gasp of delight when the sky exploded into fractals of light.
                    <br><br>
                    The event was sprawling, drawing a crowd of what must have been close to 10,000 people. Despite
                    this, or
                    perhaps because chaos favours coincidence, I managed to run into Nat and Mehmet. It’s funny how
                    that
                    happens, isn’t it? A field filled with strangers, and yet two friends materialise right in front
                    of
                    you.
                    Nat was, predictably, carrying a giant cup of overpriced hot chocolate, while Mehmet complained
                    about
                    the “atrocious” music selection. To be fair, I agree with him. We shared some laughs, our
                    critiques
                    of
                    the night interwoven with genuine moments of camaraderie. Mehmet, in his usual theatrical
                    fashion,
                    declared that this was “all a load of bollocks” while simultaneously stealing marshmallows from
                    a
                    nearby
                    stand when the vendor’s back was turned. I’m starting to like him more and more.
                    <br><br>
                    As the night wore on, I found myself conflicted. Bonfire Night wasn’t what it used to be, but
                    perhaps it
                    wasn’t meant to be. Traditions change, evolve, and are often co-opted by the ever-hungry machine
                    of
                    consumer culture. Yet, I found a kind of solace in the unexpected: a group of exchange students,
                    a
                    couple of like-minded cynics from Stockholm, and friends reappearing in a field lit up by fire
                    and
                    noise. Maybe, despite my gripes and my instinct to critique, the night had something to offer
                    after
                    all.
                    Or maybe I’m just grasping at straws, trying to give meaning to a night I didn’t really want to
                    attend.
                    Who knows? Either way, I got some good photos out of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, trying to explain the importance of Bonfire night to international students is harder than
                    I
                    thought. Yes, I told them the tale about Guy Fawkes trying to destroy parliament to remove
                    Protestant
                    rule and replace it with Catholic leadership. But why do we celebrate this? We don’t celebrate
                    the
                    last
                    person to be hanged in this country by selling miniature hanging sets and tying mannequins up
                    with a
                    noose. That’s the great thing about getting people from other cultures coming to England. They
                    look
                    at
                    our traditions with a fresh perspective and can discover just how bizarre they are to outsiders.
                    I
                    can’t
                    wait to hear their views on Panto season.

                    One deadline down, another one in seven days. This one involves programming a functioning
                    application so
                    everything could go wrong. I’ve been staring at the same ninety lines of code, perplexed at why
                    they
                    won’t run. I’ve approached the problem every way I can think of and yet, I’m still hitting
                    errors.
                    I’ve
                    been here for so long that I am wanting to drop the module. Surely, I can just <em>live off the

                    like George and Lennie dreamt of; away from technology and programming languages. Or do Workaway

                    Ten
                    hours of thinking incessantly about the same problem will do that to a person. Well, enough for
                    today.

                    Today, I had the fantastic opportunity to join a BBC Writers Room Zoom call—a Q&A about what to
                    expect
                    for their upcoming Open Call. For a full month, the BBC Writers Room opens its submission portal
                    to
                    anyone with a story to tell. This means writers of all backgrounds can submit scripts for TV
                    dramas,
                    radio plays, comedies, children’s shows, and more. The BBC will then review every submission,
                    seeking
                    promising voices to nurture and develop into accomplished writers. The selection process is
                    highly
                    competitive, but it’s an incredible chance to break into the industry. I’d be remiss not to give
                    it
                    a
                    shot by submitting one of my own stories and seeing where it might lead.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I think about which story I’m submitting, I’ve got to proofread my 4000 word case
                    analysis
                    before
                    tomorrow's midday deadline. It is 99% finished; I just need to dot the i’s and cross the t’s.
                    Once
                    that’s out the way, I can focus on building our coffee shop mobile application before the
                    deadline
                    next
                    weekend. Dilan has almost finished the front end features, so I need to catch up to complete the
                    admin
                    side of things. I’ve also been assigned the task of writing the documentation also because ‘I
                    have a
                    way
                    with words’.

                    One of the topics which came up yesterday at the exchange debrief was the Abbey Park Bonfire
                    taking
                    place on Saturday night. It’s normally £30 but I received an email this afternoon from DMUGlobal
                    stating
                    that I have won a ticket in the raffle. There are twenty-four of us going in total - a mix of
                    DMU
                    students and incoming exchange students so Amena has warned me to be on my best behaviour. I
                    think
                    this
                    was a tacit reminder to not scare off the new intake, which is ironic considering it’s the one
                    time
                    of
                    year where scares are permitted. That should be something to look forward to in any case. I have
                    a
                    few
                    new tricks I want to try out with my camera after getting private lessons from a new friend from
                    the
                    media society who is doing photography as part of her course.

                <h2>Wednesday, 30th October</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re on fire! Literally. We were told upon moving in that if the fire alarm were ever to sound
                    for
                    longer than two minutes, it is not a drill. Because I’m sceptical by nature, probably a
                    hindrance
                    rather
                    than a strength in this scenario, I waited for five minutes before deciding to head out. I knew
                    it
                    was
                    for real by the panicked countenance of the staff; all lining up on the other side of the road
                    with
                    their matching high-vis jackets on, trying to herd everyone to the end of the road. I didn’t
                    stick
                    around because I had the Erasmus debrief at the campus. This was an opportunity for everyone who
                    had
                    attended a University abroad, to catch up, exchange stories, and ultimately try to make everyone
                    jealous
                    about their chosen city so how could I resist. Little did I know that it would be me that was
                    made
                    jealous.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a small gathering. Intimate enough for everyone to be heard. There were some faces which
                    I
                    recognised from the departure meetings and some new who were just brimming with mirth to share
                    their
                    anecdotes. Hearing their tales made me realise just how unfulfilled my time abroad was. I could
                    list
                    my
                    excuses; the campus was outside of the city, I was the only Englishman in the faculty, there
                    were no
                    societies or clubs specifically for erasmus students. The list could go on, but I have to accept
                    that
                    the
                    main problem was me. I tried to be approachable and gregarious. Going on museum trips with
                    people
                    from
                    my accommodation, I played futsal as frequently as I could in the Sports centre. I met plenty of
                    people
                    but most/all remained just passing acquaintances. My only faithful companion was my shadow, but
                    even
                    he
                    left during the four months of snow and saturnine weather.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t think this was all my fault. The herd mentality of the Germans or the piss-poor
                    organisation
                    of
                    events by Stockholm University didn’t help but rather hindered my involvement throughout the
                    year.
                    This
                    may be a weak vindication, but it doesn’t change the fact that if it wasn’t for futsal, I could
                    have
                    completed the course from my room in Darlington. What was I supposed to say when asked about the
                    great
                    things I did? The winter started in early November and didn’t end till late March, so I stayed
                    in my
                    room
                    watching Film Noir. When the sun came out again in the Spring, I was counting down the days till
                    it
                    was
                    over. I did go travelling to the surrounding countries which is memorable but what sort of
                    advertisement
                    is that for my year in Stockholm. ‘The best thing I did was leave to explore other places’.
                    <br><br>
                    I felt a profound emptiness watching others revel in the experiences I had hoped to share. How
                    different
                    it all would have been had I gained admission to my first choice in Charleston, South Carolina.
                    What
                    aggravates me most is the absurdity of my own decision-making: I am studying Spanish - SO WHY
                    DIDN’T
                    I
                    GO TO FUCKING SPAIN. That was, quite possibly, the greatest opportunity I’ll ever have to
                    immerse
                    myself. My rationale at the time was that Deusto University in Bilbao was my only option, a city
                    I’d
                    already visited. But truly, did that matter? Tilly, a girl in the debrief, spent the year in
                    Barcelona
                    and now she is almost fluent in Spanish.
                    <br><br>
                    I get incredibly depressed when I reminisce. Such a great opportunity spurned. Was it the place,
                    the
                    people or me? Whatever it was, it’s over now. It’s on my degree. I just wished I had better
                    memories
                    associated with my time away. Fun anecdotes which I could share. People who I’ve kept in touch
                    with.
                    Instead, I’m left with embellishments and fantasies that mask the reality of that year: the
                    course
                    was
                    online, the people were distant, and the city was cold.
                    <br><br>
                    To try and find some positives from the meeting; I met some cool new people who are worldly and
                    intrepid. We also met with the first group of incoming exchange students studying at DMU for the
                    first
                    semester. Masking my dejection, I played the part we were expected to play and welcomed the new
                    students
                    with warmth and excitement though I felt like I wanted to be a million miles away.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, St Martin’s House is still standing so I assume it was only a small conflagration.

                <p>
                    Do dreams signify anything real? That was the discussion at the magazine meeting this evening.
                    Horoscopes, tea leaves, dreams - I tend to fall on the side of science. Premonitions and
                    out-of-body
                    experiences are purely chemical reactions that are interpreted as something ethereal due to
                    external
                    factors. Dreams are just your subconscious stringing together random thoughts and populating
                    them
                    with
                    real people or locations. Excuse my incredulity, but solipsism will get me much further in life
                    than
                    the
                    belief in mythical or ostensible pantheons. My philosophical stance, which holds that one’s own
                    mind
                    is
                    the only certainty, should convey my scepticism regarding this sort of thing, but I am not here
                    to
                    convert others to my pessimistic beliefs. If they want to assign credence and meaning to dreams
                    -
                    even
                    though they lack empirical support - I will indulge them.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe it’s because none of my dreams are meaningful or remotely insightful. Real life isn’t like
                    the
                    movies, where one has a dream and then changes their entire life; goes travelling, gets married,
                    starts
                    a majestic new journey. Nope, mine are much more tangible. The only epiphany I’ve had, which
                    came to
                    me
                    in a dream, is the realisation that university was the only way out of the rut I found myself in
                    four
                    years ago.
                    <br><br>
                    What does it mean when dreamers fixate on a single person? A dear friend, a lost loved one - do
                    these
                    dreams whisper secrets from our subconscious, inviting us to explore a reality that exists only
                    in
                    the
                    playground of our minds? I find myself greeting my granddad every now and then. It’s not a
                    heart-wrenching reunion where I’m painfully reminded of his absence, nor a prophetic vision that
                    warns
                    me of what’s to come. No, it’s a simple acknowledgment, a moment where I can picture him
                    standing
                    side
                    by side with Nana. In those dreams, I softly whisper, “It’s good to see you again,” cherishing
                    the
                    fleeting connection that binds us beyond the veil of reality. Even if it is just a wave of
                    chemicals, a
                    surge of neurons firing in the night, I wake up feeling comforted by the memories that linger.
                    <br><br>
                    The afterlife isn’t a notion I readily embrace, but I refuse to diminish the hopes of those who
                    do.
                    In
                    moments of quiet reflection, I can’t help but wonder about what lies beyond this life. My time
                    here
                    feels precious, a gift I want to savour fully. I hold on to the belief that time is fleeting,
                    that
                    what
                    will be will be. And in that understanding, I strive to make every moment count, finding meaning
                    in
                    the
                    little things.

                <p>
                    Woke up to a wonderful email this morning - which is a nice change from the ominous, incessant
                    reminders
                    of coursework deadlines as per usual. I’m off to Paris! A DMUGlobal opportunity themed around
                    employability and team building skills. I must confess, my ulterior motive is to see the sights.
                    I
                    have
                    been known to throw a sickie from time to time to have an adventure around London so I may
                    deploy
                    these
                    similar tactics whilst in Paris too! <em>I always get a 24 hour flu around April anyway. </em>
                    Paris
                    has
                    been on my itinerary for a while and this gives me the perfect opportunity to see the sights on
                    the
                    university’s dime. During the DMUGlobal trip to Bilbao in 2021, there were several people
                    ostensibly
                    suffering from heat stroke therefore remained in their rooms for two or three days. Yep - I was
                    dubious
                    about their excuses too. Paris however, is much larger than Bilbao and I only have a meagre five
                    days to
                    cover everything. I won’t have time for university organised activities - not with my full
                    itinerary.

                <p>
                    I just had one of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever experienced. Compared to the strident
                    environment
                    of the hostel, even my springy mattress felt like an upgrade. With two days off work, I had to
                    race
                    against the clock to catch up on the progress Dilan had made in our coursework. We’ve exchanged
                    our
                    Case
                    Analysis essays to peer review each other’s work before the Friday deadline. Dilan’s expertise
                    is
                    firmly
                    rooted in coding—he knows the concepts inside and out—but translating those ideas into academic
                    vernacular is not his strong suit. It took me over two hours to decipher his work and shape it
                    into
                    a
                    cohesive paper. His draft was weighed down with superfluous detail and language that felt too
                    casual
                    for
                    an academic setting. Meanwhile, I have a whole lexicon of words I rarely use, like “good enough”
                    or
                    “a
                    lot of.” Words like “efficient” and “plethora” feel far more mellifluous. It makes me appreciate
                    the
                    writing journey I’ve been on over the years because I know I once wrote just like
                    Dilan—expressing
                    ideas
                    without much thought for verbiage or a skill for succinct language.

                <p>
                    It’s 2:20 AM, and as I write this, I’m listening to the falsetto snores coming from the other
                    bunks.
                    Each snorer sings at a different octave, slightly out of rhythm with the others. I can actually
                    monitor
                    which part of their sleep cycles they are in by the intermission of their snores, which is not
                    helpful
                    for getting back to sleep. I long for sleep, but my mind remains vigilant, refusing to rest in
                    the
                    darkness. Since there is no hope of relief until my comrades in the trenches move into their
                    non-REM
                    sleep patterns, let me tell you about my day.
                    <br><br>
                    The first problem I encountered was all the trains getting cancelled due to signalling issues.
                    <em>The
                        sooner labour nationalise the railways, the bloody better.</em> Only one train was departing
                    for
                    London,
                    so a
                    hundred passengers were rushing for a spot or a seat if you’re one of the lucky ones. I was on
                    my
                    way to
                    the Capital and that’s all I could ask for.
                    <br><br>
                    Making it to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane with minutes to spare, I took my seat and witnessed
                    one of
                    the
                    most inquisitive conversations I have ever seen about Shakespeare. I initially misunderstood the
                    format
                    of the interview; Greg Doran is not the host but the interviewee next to David Tennant. Given
                    his
                    vast
                    portfolio of plays and productions - and his book to sell - it became evident that Tennant was
                    only
                    there primarily for marketing purposes. Starting as an actor, Doran moved into directing in the
                    '90s
                    and
                    has since completed Shakespeare productions from all three folios. If it were an interview with
                    just
                    him, it would have still been intriguing but due to his backstage role, his reputation does not
                    garner
                    the same respect as David’s. But what a man. Full of anecdotes and wit. A truly-talented
                    raconteur
                    with
                    a penchant for storytelling. I am more inclined to see one of his productions from observing the
                    talent
                    and discernment he has in approaching Shakespeare.
                    <br><br>
                    Next to me was a girl named Mary-Jane, a history major who just graduated from Edinburgh
                    University.
                    We
                    shared stories and our Shakespeare favourites. Congenial people coming together to share an
                    experience—this is what I imagine Comic-Con is like. Everyone with the same passions in the same
                    room.
                    However, I must say that the theatre looked half-empty, possibly due to the train cancellations.
                    Covertly snapping a few photographs at the curtain call, I was pleased I moved my train forward
                    a
                    day to
                    accommodate this interview.

                    <br><br>
                    I may have just witnessed some of the best performances of my life. The intensity, the
                    foreboding,
                    the
                    raw passion of a Shakespeare aficionado - it all left me in awe. I had forgotten how profoundly
                    dark
                    Macbeth can be, but this production brought that darkness to life with majestic power. The
                    script
                    stayed
                    true, almost verbatim, to the second folio. The emotions felt raw and genuine, with tears as
                    real as
                    Macduff's searing vengeance against Macbeth. These are the Shakespearian greats which we are
                    witnessing
                    and their resonance is unparalleled.
                    <br><br>
                    This adaptation brought its own ingenuity to the performance by having the audience wear
                    headphones
                    throughout. This allowed us to hear the witches' cackles and howls directly, bypassing the
                    challenges of
                    portraying them on stage. Each actor wore a microphone, enabling them to whisper their
                    monologues,
                    so
                    the pain and intensity in their voices didn’t need to be projected across the theatre. The
                    Celtic
                    overtones of the performance remained true to its Scottish roots, while an added ecclesiastical
                    edge
                    made the experience even more ominous, with the sounds of disconcerting whispers playing
                    directly in
                    our
                    ears.
                    <br><br>
                    This adaptation left me with a sense of awe and a renewed appreciation for the power of theatre.
                    The
                    intimacy of the whispered lines and the eerie soundscapes drew me into the world of Macbeth like
                    never
                    before, making me feel as though I was right there amidst the turmoil and tragedy. It was a
                    reminder
                    of
                    why I love Shakespeare—his ability to explore the depths of human emotion in ways that still
                    resonate
                    today. As I walked away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had witnessed something special,
                    something
                    that would stay with me long after the final echo of the witches’ cackle had faded.

                <h2>Friday, 25th October</h2>
                <p>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it’s back to London I go. With my student loans to fund the shows, heigh-ho,
                    heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s right. Back to the citadel. Why? Because Shakespeare demands it. <em>Thus fate, that hath
                        made me
                        servant to it,</em> leads me back to the Globe. Tonight, I am watching the penultimate
                    matinee
                    of
                    The Taming
                    of the Shrew at the Globe Theatre; the final show of the season before the future productions
                    move
                    indoors to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. I’m going to be well wrapped up, for the cold October
                    air
                    can be
                    unforgiving when permeating the Wooden O. (Shakespeare described the Globe as the Wooden O in
                    Henry
                    V).
                    <br><br>
                    But that’s not all. No disrespect to Petruchio and Katherina, but their love quarrel doesn’t
                    warrant
                    a
                    trip to London by themselves. No, no, no—the pièce de résistance starts this afternoon with the
                    first of
                    two parts of my David Tennant extravaganza. I am watching an interview at the Royal Drury
                    Theatre
                    hosted
                    by venerated Shakespeare impresario, Greg Doran interviewing the tenth doctor himself. This is
                    in
                    addition to their ongoing run of Macbeth which I’m seeing tomorrow. The King of Scotland, played
                    by
                    David Tennant, supported by Cush Jumbo starts at two pm. I have been flirting with these tickets
                    for
                    months until one glorious day a few weeks ago where the last minute tickets were released at
                    cut-rate
                    prices. Low enough for me to justify the purchase. <em>And so let the wind grow cold and the
                        night
                        creep
                        upon us; let the curtain rise on this thrilling adventure, and so, with eager hearts, we
                        step
                        boldly
                        into the night, where our destinies await!</em>
                    <br><br>
                    PS. I am staying in a hostel for the first time in my life where I will be sharing my room with
                    three
                    other people like a common peasant. If I haven’t published a blog by Sunday evening detailing my
                    trip,
                    come looking for me. I’m staying at the Astor Hyde Park Hostel. <em>Please save me . . .</em>

                    <br><br>
                    This evening marked my second trip to the Globe Theatre in as many weeks. Taming of the Shrew is
                    one
                    of
                    the few works in Shakespeare's body of work that hasn’t been significantly altered to align with
                    contemporary themes of female empowerment and social justice. I won’t provide a full analysis
                    here,
                    as
                    most of you may not be interested, but I will publish my review elsewhere. I will say that it
                    was a
                    slight disappointment compared to the high expectations I had. The culmination of the play
                    didn’t
                    match
                    the anodyne tone established throughout, leaving me feeling unfulfilled. For a comedy, it relied
                    too
                    heavily on modern contemporary language for laughs rather than on the nuanced Shakespearean
                    lexicon
                    from
                    the script.
                    <br><br>
                    The journey to South Kensington was uneventful, yet a sense of trepidation coursed through me as
                    tales
                    of hostel living raced through my mind. The hostel felt somewhat incongruous given its
                    surroundings.
                    The
                    street is lined with foreign embassies and law-firms, high-end real estates and Imperial College
                    London
                    sharing the same pathways. Just around the corner stands the Royal Albert Hall, a major landmark
                    steeped
                    in London’s history. In stark contrast to its elegant neighbours, the Astor hostel shares an
                    imposing
                    façade but lacks the decorous opulence within.
                    <br><br>
                    Friday night in a hostel has more in common with a nightclub than a hotel. The common room is a
                    chaotic
                    scene, littered with beer pong tables and DJ decks in the corner. There are spills, thrills, and
                    even
                    some pills being passed among travellers. The alcohol-stained wooden floors make every step a
                    sticky
                    ordeal. Couples are canoodling on the stairs—apparently, a quick way to get to know the
                    locals—and I
                    find myself stepping over something I’d rather not think about as I try to make my way to my
                    room.
                    <br><br>
                    The room itself is sparse, furnished only with bunk beds. I’m sharing the space with three
                    others—Till,
                    Kenny, and Nuno, according to the labels on their bunks. I was ready for bed by midnight; I kept
                    my
                    belongings close, slept in my clothes, and looped my backpack strap around my wrist. My parents
                    taught
                    me to be vigilant, to trust no one. I might be crafty in seizing opportunities, but I’m not a
                    thief.
                    As
                    for these travellers? I don’t know their stories. Come first light, I’ll be out of here like a
                    whippet.

                <p>
                    It’s hacking time! Last week was the last taster session for DMU hackers which means this week
                    is
                    exclusively for members only. Those of us who are serious about the subject. Being a final year
                    student
                    I have a quasi knowledge base surrounding the topics we will be covering. This evening, we were
                    starting
                    off easy by introducing the Linux operating system to the newbies. We were all beginners at some
                    point
                    so we need to be patient with them. Because I’m not part of the committee, I don’t need to help
                    these
                    neophytes out so I spent my time developing a brute force algorithm which can crack passwords in
                    less
                    than thirty seconds. Sounds impressive, but the real impetus is a bit more mundane—I forgot my
                    Airbnb
                    password, and I’ll need it soon.
                    <br><br>
                    After the session, it’s off to Soar Point, the student pub that’s the hub of society socials.
                    I’m
                    involved in so many societies this year that I never enter the pub without finding at least one
                    group I
                    can comfortably join. Tonight, I spent the first half hour with my fellow coders, debating
                    whether
                    Blockchain is overrated and if the moon landing could have been more efficient had the software
                    been
                    built on open-source foundations. I bet your curiosity is almost palpable.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, I joined the Racing team for a few quick pub games before settling down with Mehmet
                    to
                    watch
                    Fenerbahçe vs. Man Utd. As kickoff approached, more of his Turkish friends joined us, each one
                    welcomed
                    into the fold. It wasn’t until we left that I found out some of them were complete strangers.
                    This
                    is
                    what I missed in Stockholm: a welcoming group of Englishmen where we could catch up and enjoy
                    our
                    home
                    away from home. Instead, I was the only Brit in the Computer Science faculty there, and a social
                    pariah
                    among the Germans. <em>I probably shouldn’t have made those war jokes.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Surrounded by a dozen Turks, I knew they were passionate supporters, famous for setting off
                    flares
                    and
                    chanting fiercely back home. It was no surprise when that same fervour filled Soar Point as
                    Fenerbahçe
                    scored, their rich footballing heritage coming alive in every cheer and shout. This is football
                    at
                    its
                    finest. It was a stark contrast to the women’s game I watched in the pub a few weeks ago, where
                    two
                    men
                    were escorted out for their overly enthusiastic behaviour.

                <p>
                    The second day of the careers fair was just as informative as I’d hoped. It offered a chance for
                    a
                    face-to-face with sectors beyond the IT realm, allowing me to explore whether I have
                    transferable
                    skills
                    that might align with them. One opportunity that truly piqued my interest was a selection of
                    advertising
                    firms—billed as "1001 jobs under one roof." Their graduate schemes offer training across a wide
                    range of
                    fields, including writing, media, software, animation, and various other areas of production.
                    Hitherto,
                    I hadn't considered opportunities outside of Software Development or related IT roles, but I
                    must
                    admit,
                    the prospect of applying is quite tempting.

                    Alongside the multitude of advertising firms, the automotive industry made a strong showing at
                    the
                    fair.
                    High-end brands like Bentley and Aston Martin drew large crowds, much of which seemed driven by
                    the
                    allure of working for such prestigious names. However, according to my friends in engineering,
                    unless
                    you’re joining at a senior or managerial level, it’s often more advantageous to start with a
                    more
                    approachable brand like Mini or Volkswagen.
                    <br><br>
                    The demand for data scientists is strong, especially vis-a-vis software engineering roles—these
                    companies seek experts who can monitor telemetry, uncover patterns, and enhance UI/UX.
                    Ironically,
                    many
                    of these automotive giants have their headquarters in Milton Keynes, which discourages some from
                    making
                    the move. As for me, I consider myself adaptable and would relocate wherever opportunity calls.

                <p>
                    It’s crunch time. The case analysis has been released as well as the coding coursework. I have a
                    fortnight to complete both which is achievable but it does mean it’s going to be a long two
                    weeks.
                    The
                    case analysis is simple. 4000 words delineating the ethics challenges of a fictitious company.
                    (I
                    have
                    already completed 2000 words in three days.) The coursework is proving to be more tortuous,
                    especially
                    because I am paired with Dilan who wants to program it so it is compatible with the Starship
                    Enterprise.
                    My issue isn’t keeping up with the lectures and labs, it’s keeping up with Dilan’s vision for
                    this
                    project. Nevertheless, it’s going to be the most advanced exercise on my portfolio regardless.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also prescient about what I want to be doing after university. Graduate schemes and
                    apprenticeships
                    are all being released in the coming weeks; therefore, the first careers fair of the season
                    kicked
                    off
                    today. The companies that hosted the event last week were among those invited today. Peregrine,
                    JLR,
                    and
                    Caterpillar all recognised me from those activities and strongly urged—using their exact
                    vernacular—that
                    I apply for their vacancies. Does it count as being headhunted if I am approached during a
                    recruitment
                    event? Nevertheless, I updated my CV yesterday in preparation. Some deadlines are as early as
                    November
                    1st, so it’s going to be a busy few weeks.

                    This evening, I had to break the bad news to the Futsal team that I’d have to retire from the
                    season
                    before our first match. Why? Well, because my overly-scheduled timetable can’t accommodate the
                    intense
                    futsal schedule. The room went silent. There were looks of disbelief and incredulity all around,
                    like
                    I’d just announced that I was actually an alien in disguise.
                    <br><br>
                    “Wait, what do you mean you’re quitting?” someone blurted out. I couldn’t give them the real
                    reason
                    so I
                    fabricated an injury. The audacity of it. The betrayal. Why would anyone want to quit football?
                    They
                    couldn’t understand why the guy they nicknamed ‘Cole Palmer’ would want to focus on other
                    things.
                    Meanwhile, the coach’s face looked like he’d just bitten into a lemon. More annoyed than
                    disappointed, I
                    could almost see the gears turning in his head: Great, the diversity hire has just quit my team.
                    I
                    bet
                    he’s thinking that. I’ll find out for sure when I meet my replacement—probably some guy named
                    Charles
                    who plays lacrosse and ultimate frisbee. Goes hiking on a weekend and drives a Subaru Outback
                    with a
                    mountain bike strapped to the roof. What a tit.
                    <br><br>
                    After some awkward goodbyes and a half-hearted “Stay in touch!” (which we all knew wouldn’t
                    happen),
                    I
                    snuck upstairs to my Pilates class. As I lay on my mat, trying to channel my inner peace and
                    hold a
                    bridge pose, I couldn’t help but contemplate my decisions. This is for the best. It’s my final
                    year
                    and
                    I do have plenty of other commitments which I want to focus on. Writing for the Magazine,
                    producing
                    for
                    the Demon FM, designing and developing the car components, attending Hack-a-thons with the
                    Hackers.
                    This
                    is the best for the long run. At least I hope it is.

                    I finished reading the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath; the only full length novel published under her
                    nom
                    de
                    plume Victoria Lucas, a few months before her death in 1963. Historically, it’s categorised as a
                    semi-autobiographical novel as Plath took inspiration from her own time spent in mental
                    institutions
                    and
                    embellished the tales of her acquaintances from that time. I’m incredulous how no one knew she
                    was
                    suicidal given the tell-tale signs in her work. Most of her short stories follow the same
                    depressive
                    theme and include suicide or self-harm. If that wasn’t a salient hint, most are written in first
                    person.
                    She was literally transcribing her own pain and no one looked past the facade of her fictitious
                    stories.
                    The Bell Jar was particularly appealing for me because of the 50s setting which came with
                    esoteric
                    references which I am proud to say I understood. Sydney Greenstreet, Gloria Grahame, Shelley
                    Winters.

                    <br><br>
                    Switching from the macabre subject of Sylvia Plath to the exciting prospects of a trip to Paris,
                    I
                    have
                    submitted my application for the cultural integration and employability trip taking place in
                    early
                    Spring. The deadline is Monday but since the case studio deadline for my coursework is in a
                    fortnight, I
                    don’t want any other distractions. Between now and then, I have applications which I want to
                    submit
                    for
                    JLR, and a couple other companies from the careers day on Thursday. I have only just started my
                    final
                    year but most internship and graduate programs for the summer close their applications in the
                    coming
                    months so I need to keep on top of that as well.

                <p>
                    My affinity for new experiences continued with the first session of Demon FM held in the campus
                    broadcasting studio. Backed by the DSU and the media faculty, I’m amazed by the apparent
                    indifference
                    toward the society, especially given all the amazing equipment we have at our disposal—cameras,
                    sound
                    gear, TV broadcasting decks, and everything needed to send signals out into the world. This
                    raises
                    some
                    doubts about the activities and management structure, but for now, I’m keeping an open mind to
                    all
                    the
                    information being shared.
                    <br><br>
                    I was especially eager for this evening’s session after enduring four long hours of seminars on
                    computer
                    ethics. My mind had wandered through a labyrinth of jargon and legalese, each term more tedious
                    than
                    the
                    last. It felt like the life had been drained from the room, leaving behind a dull echo of
                    buzzwords
                    and
                    ethical dilemmas that seemed to spiral into an abyss of ambiguity. Yawn. Normally, I wouldn’t
                    approach
                    any part of a module with apathy, but I have already completed two modules dedicated to computer
                    ethics
                    during my tenure at De Montfort.
                    <br><br>
                    The only positive from enduring this academic purgatory was getting a rundown of the case study
                    which
                    accounts for 20% of our grade for this module: a 4000 word essay delineating the challenges and
                    opportunities a fictitious start-up faces when trying to balance innovation with ethics. Simple
                    enough.
                    I get a certain Joie de vivre as Delboy would say, from writing essays but I feel like my
                    penmanship
                    is
                    being curtailed by others who use AI to complete their essays. It is hard to discern excellence
                    if
                    every
                    essay is of the same quality. That leads to a sea of mediocrity. My writing is NOT mediocre, but
                    compared to the omniscience abilities of ChatGPT, my verisimilitude will be punished.

                    Life unfolds in chapters, each one offering a chance for change, growth, and sometimes, an
                    unexpected
                    shift in the narrative. Just as a story builds with each new scene, so does the character of a
                    person—moulded by moments of challenge, introspection, and the subtle pressures that shape our
                    responses
                    to the world. We begin as one version of ourselves, clinging to familiar roles, but life has a
                    way
                    of
                    pushing us into new acts, whether we are ready or not. These turning points, often disguised as
                    ordinary
                    days, reveal how far we've come from the people we once were, and hint at the potential of who
                    we
                    might
                    become.
                    <br><br>
                    In the last three years alone, I have left home, started university, conquered my fear of
                    flying,
                    and
                    lived in a foreign country. The list of fears and anxieties that had plagued me for so long has
                    diminished with every passing year, leaving only one solitary fear left. Though I am not free of
                    this
                    burden, I understand the importance of acknowledging this vast journey—recognising the introvert
                    I
                    was
                    and the person I’ve become. Today, on an ordinary day like any other, an opportunity presented
                    itself in
                    the form of a careers event hosted by JLR (Jaguar Land Rover), offering a chance to reflect on
                    this
                    transformation.
                    <br><br>
                    The event began with an informal Q&A designed to inspire, as the tagline suggested, but
                    unfortunately,
                    it quickly gave way to a sense of ennui. Alas, although some parts were informative and
                    interesting,
                    the
                    hour-long advertisement for the company felt unnecessarily prolonged and could have been
                    shortened
                    to a
                    succinct fifteen-minute presentation.. The following two hours was a coalition of tasks and
                    exercises
                    which were part of JLR’s employment process to give us short tasters on the joys to expect if we
                    apply
                    for entry level/graduate roles.
                    <br><br>
                    We were divided into three groups, rotating through the different tasks. Curiously, the majority
                    of
                    my
                    peers hailed from Cyber Security rather than Software Development or Computer Science, which was
                    odd,
                    given that none of the available graduate programmes catered to their background. The exercises
                    were
                    largely focused on soft skills—the kind that are crucial in most professions—though each task
                    was
                    modelled after real components from JLR’s past application processes.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the tasks required us to give a ten-minute presentation as a team, focusing on the future
                    of
                    electric vehicles and what innovations we could bring to JLR. As is typical in situations where
                    strangers are forced to collaborate, everyone initially avoided eye contact, busied themselves
                    with
                    their phones, and waited for someone else to take the lead. I can’t stand these moments; it
                    would be
                    so
                    much easier if everyone just communicated openly and tackled the task head-on. Assuming the role
                    of
                    project manager, I spearheaded the conversation into a productive discussion. Eventually, we
                    settled
                    on
                    a few safe, pragmatic ideas—concepts that other luxury brands had already implemented, ensuring
                    we
                    wouldn’t stray too far from familiar territory.
                    <br><br>
                    Delivering these ideas with a sense of confidence and ease is a skill that many lack, often
                    because
                    it’s
                    simply not emphasised in public schools. This is one reason why so many politicians and CEOs
                    thrive
                    in
                    their fields—class and background play a significant role. The basics of clear speech and proper
                    enunciation are foundational to public speaking, but my team struggled with these. Hearing our
                    ideas
                    relayed in a monotone mumble felt almost painful, lacking the energy and conviction that a
                    strong
                    pitch
                    requires.
                    <br><br>
                    Then it was my turn. I could liken myself to Thomas Skinner in the delivery of my pitch, but
                    I’ll
                    refrain. The task was meant to simulate a direct pitch to JLR departments, but I treated it like
                    a
                    sales
                    opportunity, crafting my delivery to convey the lifestyle and essence of a Jaguar owner. I
                    emphasised
                    the opulence and class associated with the brand, painting a vivid picture for the audience
                    before
                    seamlessly tying it back to user experience and the comfort of Jaguar’s electric vehicles. It
                    was
                    beautiful. Smooth, confident, engaging. I couldn’t have done it any better if I had tried.
                    <br><br>
                    After my performance in the presentation and spearheading the discussions on the subsequent
                    tasks, I
                    was
                    approached by Nuri, a representative of JLR, to gauge my interest in the graduate schemes.
                    Explaining
                    that I was an aspiring Software Developer, he lamented explaining the difficulties of achieving
                    that
                    role without a masters degree. He went on to expound the perks and benefits of working in
                    project
                    management. He emphasised how my strengths—generating ideas, steering discussions, and creating
                    a
                    positive atmosphere—would serve me well in that field, and his feedback gave me pause to reflect
                    on
                    skills I hadn’t fully recognised in myself before.
                    <br><br>
                    Mmm, interesting. Before today, I was ignorant that I possessed this specific skill set so my
                    sceptical
                    demeanour is telling me that I must have just been with some extremely laconic people for these
                    tasks
                    instead of being an exceptional leader. But perhaps there’s more to this than I initially
                    thought—maybe
                    I’ve been underestimating my potential in areas outside of software development.
                    <br><br>
                    Irrespective of this positive introspection, I think it is beneficial to acknowledge what I’ve
                    learnt,
                    not just about the careers available but that I have grown as a person. Despite my reservations
                    of
                    the
                    successes of my Erasmus year, my implicit assimilation of these soft skills has been put to the
                    test
                    this afternoon and I have surprised myself at my capabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    It was clear that I was no longer the passive participant I once was. Instead, I had become
                    someone
                    who
                    could navigate the complexities of group dynamics, articulate thoughts under pressure, and most
                    surprisingly, bring out the best in those around me. The introverted neophyte, the part I was
                    once
                    so
                    comfortable to play, has outgrown me, making way to a new character. The start of a new Act. May
                    tomorrow yield the same bright torch as today.

                    My neck is better which is fortunate because I have the Racing team meeting and the Demon Media
                    Magazine
                    workshops today. Both were semi-introductory events with the Racing society proving to be more
                    popular
                    on the day. There are two meetings, I’ve since found out. One for the casual learners like
                    myself,
                    and a
                    dedicated meeting for the mechanical engineers who are obliged to partake in the workshop
                    elements
                    as
                    part of their final year project. The team leader is as stereotypical as you might think with
                    sponsored
                    polo shirts and a brummie accent. He can’t be much older than me which undermines his authority
                    in
                    the
                    workshop.
                    <br><br>
                    Demon media magazine was a short and succinct session outlining the format of the latest edition
                    and
                    the
                    scheduling around it. We are working towards the Winter edition which is due to be released in
                    early
                    December. The categories are open ended meaning we can write about almost anything and they will
                    publish. This laissez-faire attitude is what makes the previous releases seem disjointed and
                    unprofessional. Pick a niche and dedicate the magazine to it instead of mixing a creative
                    writing
                    publication with a political satire overview. Personally, it doesn’t make sense to me but it’s
                    not
                    my
                    place to dictate over. The elections for editor-in-chief are due to be held next week and as
                    tempted
                    as
                    I am to nominate myself, I am not looking for another obligation to dedicate my time to. I can
                    still
                    make a difference by producing quality articles as and when I want.

                    The shunt last night affected me more than I initially thought. I woke up this morning unable to
                    turn my
                    head, and I have to keep everything straight to ease the pain. A couple of friends from the
                    racing
                    society came over to check on me (since, after the track doctor gave me the all-clear last
                    night,
                    why
                    not get a second opinion from more ersatz medical professionals too?). They think it's probably
                    a
                    bad
                    sprain, but if I still can't turn my head by this time tomorrow, I'll see an actual doctor
                    instead
                    of
                    relying on these self-proclaimed ones. The only way I can turn is by moving my entire body which
                    makes
                    me look like a life-sized marionette. On a more optimistic note, I have devoted the day to
                    coding,
                    which
                    has put me a few lectures ahead so every cloud has a silver lining I guess.

                <p>
                    Let’s Go Karting! The highly anticipated taster session took place this evening, with slots
                    allocated on
                    a first-come-first-served basis to the first thirty individuals who checked the Karting group
                    chat
                    this
                    morning. That’s right—last-minute planning and a limited number of spaces. Pilates would have to
                    be
                    postponed for yet another week.
                    <br><br>
                    The main draw? Everything was complimentary thanks to DMU Sport. I’d been eager to return to the
                    track
                    ever since rekindling my interest in F1 back in 2022, and this seemed like the perfect
                    opportunity.
                    I
                    donned my brand-new Adidas trainers, intent on breaking them in, but almost immediately upon
                    stepping
                    off the bus at the circuit, a kart whizzed by, splattering mud all over them. “Gives them
                    character,”
                    was the circuit manager’s attempt at sarcasm. I wanted to wind him...
                    <br><br>
                    Of the thirty participants, ten belonged to the Karting society, and twelve had recently been
                    karting
                    within the past year. I found myself among the minority of novices who had never been Karting
                    before.
                    The event began with three practice sessions, each accommodating ten drivers and allowing us
                    fifteen
                    minutes to familiarise ourselves with the track and record our best time. That time would
                    dictate
                    our
                    starting positions in the subsequent heats.
                    <br><br>
                    I was testing out my tires, checking my grip level, sticking to the racing line, before actually
                    attempting a flying lap. Meanwhile, there were drivers going off at every corner. Powersliding
                    round
                    the
                    bends, rearranging the cones to the pit wall. It was pandemonium. The marshals lining the track
                    offered
                    little more than feeble warnings, holding up signs that read Calm Down and Be Careful. What is
                    this,
                    a
                    token gesture to deflect liability in case we end up decapitating ourselves?
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t long after till I had my first shunt. A Verstappen wannabe dive bombed up the inside,
                    looking
                    for a gap that clearly wasn’t there. He left the braking too late and drove straight into me.
                    Thankfully, these kart can only reach 40mph otherwise I might have been in trouble. After a
                    stern
                    look
                    from the marshall and a yellow flag, we carried on with the qualifying session.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite not having driven a kart in over a decade, I managed to secure third place in my
                    qualifying
                    session with a respectable 47.3 seconds. For context, the society chair—a seasoned amateur—was
                    clocking
                    in at 41.5 seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    The race itself was as adrenaline-fueled as I had hoped. My qualifying time placed me third in
                    the
                    second heat—essentially the second group of ten. It was a rolling start, so we missed out on the
                    exhilaration of lining up on the grid and watching the lights go out. Nevertheless, after a
                    swift
                    exit
                    from the pits, I began closing in on the kart ahead. Biding my time for the first few laps, I
                    inched
                    closer and closer. Approaching the last corner, I decided to make a move up the inside.
                    Unfortunately,
                    my assigned kart lacked the same grip as the one I used during qualifying. I spun out, ending up
                    facing
                    the wrong direction on the track. The gap between me and the racers behind wasn’t as comfortable
                    as
                    I’d
                    assumed—two karts barreled into me, sending me careening off the track entirely. Red flags
                    waved,
                    and we
                    were all sent back to the pits.
                    <br><br>
                    Though I felt fine, I had to undergo a medical assessment for potential whiplash since this
                    crash
                    was
                    much more egregious than my first altercation in the practice. After a brief convalescence and a
                    thumbs-up from the ersatz doctor on site, I was cleared to return to the track. Yet, as I sit
                    here
                    writing this, my neck throbs with the lingering aftermath.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite my injury, I did manage to make that move on the pole sitter, claiming victory in my
                    heat. I
                    am
                    much too honourable to brag, but I must admit I felt a surge of gratification. Unfortunately,
                    this
                    will
                    be a one-off appearance for me, as the society membership costs £40, and I’m tighter than a drum
                    when it
                    comes to spending. Cough cough. The socials will still be available as I’ve been looking forward
                    to
                    having simpatico people to share F1 views with. Unfortunately, it looks like a great number of
                    these
                    people are Verstappen and Red Bull fans. Looks like the socials won’t be as congenial as I first
                    thought.

                <p>
                    The day after departing London is always a depressing one. From getting a taste of where I could
                    be
                    to
                    the realisation of where I am. Only eight more months in Leicester before I’m hopefully off to
                    do
                    better
                    things.
                    <br><br>
                    I have been in St Martins House for three weeks now, and it seems like the ‘honeymoon period’
                    has
                    worn
                    off. The cleanliness of the kitchen has somewhat deteriorated since I’ve been away. The stove is
                    covered
                    in dried food, crumbs have been left covering the worktops, the floor is sticky with God knows
                    what,
                    and
                    the sink is about to be clogged with the amount of food left in the drain. I’m about ready to
                    start
                    knocking on doors and cracking the whip, but in an effort to maintain the equilibrium of the
                    flat, I
                    tidied it up myself. <em>Just this once.</em> Of course, I’m not a fool—I’ve left a sarcastic
                    note
                    on
                    the
                    worktops detailing my hard labour. They can interpret it however they like.
                    <br><br>
                    Sorting the hundreds of photos from the past few days is a time-consuming job, as many are
                    similar
                    but
                    focus on different vantage points. It’s difficult to see which are considered good and which are
                    mediocre from a non-biased position since I’m the photographer. My artistic chauvinism insists
                    that
                    they
                    are all masterpieces, so I’m getting Natalia and Emily to have a look at them when I see them
                    next.
                    God,
                    is that the type of person I am? <em>“Everyone gather round whilst I show you slides of my
                    holidays.”</em>How
                    hubristic is that! Regardless, it’ll be good to get their opinions.

                    Ironically, my best night’s sleep since moving back to University has been in Liam’s bed. I
                    think

                    is the message I’ve been waiting for to invest in further padding for my springboard for a

                    I’ve
                    got currently.

                    My plan was to head swiftly to the British Museum this morning since I like to update myself on
                    the
                    exhibitions at least once a year. Since my Erasmus year in Stockholm, it’s been almost two since
                    I
                    last
                    visited. After a late one last night, time was against me. My train was departing at half two so
                    instead
                    of rushing round the museum, I opted for a photoshoot of Marble Arch instead. Again putting my
                    photography skills to the test until it was time to go.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s been another successful outing to London: two shows, a Globe Theatre tour, an F1
                    exhibition, a
                    plethora of photos and a long-overdue catchup with Matthew. Until we meet again, London, may the
                    distance be brief and my return quick upon the wind.

                <h2>Friday, 11th October</h2>
                <p>
                    After a free trip on the DLR—thanks to my confusion about where to scan my card—I arrived at the
                    ExCeL
                    Centre in East London for the Formula One exhibition. Usually, when visiting London, I stay
                    within a
                    central area—roughly bounded by St Pancras, Mile End, the Globe Theatre, and Hyde Park. This
                    time,
                    though, I ventured further, and East London didn’t disappoint. The area is beautiful, with
                    stunning
                    views, especially from the Royal Victoria Dock footbridge, which offers a spectacular vantage
                    point
                    of
                    the Canary Wharf skyline.
                    <br><br>
                    The F1 exhibition was well-curated, guiding visitors through a maze of attractions with provided
                    headphones. It delved into the sport's rich history, highlighting Bernie Ecclestone's pivotal
                    role
                    in
                    making it an international phenomenon, as well as celebrating the successes of legendary drivers
                    like
                    Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher, and Lewis Hamilton. The exhibition
                    also
                    covered important safety advancements, including the introduction of crash barriers and the
                    halo.
                    Among
                    the F1 cars on display were the RB16—not Verstappen’s record-breaking RB19 from last season—and
                    the
                    2020
                    Mercedes. One particularly striking exhibit was the charred remains of Romain Grosjean’s car
                    from
                    his
                    harrowing 2020 crash; it's a sobering sight, but a powerful reminder of how fortunate he was to
                    survive.
                    <br><br>
                    Around the venue, screens featured interviews with key figures discussing car design,
                    engineering,
                    and
                    famous rivalries between drivers and teams. For £30, the experience felt like good value,
                    offering
                    plenty of insight into the world of Formula One.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, the exhibition ended with a gift shop. I hoped to find a Mercedes Team hoodie—its
                    colours
                    more subtle than the bold orange McLaren one I had returned yesterday—but the prices were
                    eye-watering.
                    £15 for a keyring, £45 for caps, and a staggering £130 for hoodies. I wasn’t the only one taken
                    aback;
                    murmurs of incredulity echoed among the other visitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Resisting any impulse purchases, I left quickly and made my way to the Globe Theatre for a
                    guided
                    tour.
                    London's transport system is truly one of its best features—being able to travel ten miles from
                    East
                    London to London Bridge for a reasonable fare is a major advantage. It’s just a shame that the
                    railways
                    don’t share this kind of accessible pricing.
                    <br><br>
                    Arriving a little earlier than expected, I was able to take a peek inside Tate Modern. I wish I
                    could
                    say that this was a refreshing change from my go-to art venue of the National Gallery, but the
                    abstractionism on display bordered on frivolous and arid. Tate Modern focuses on modern art from
                    the
                    past century. This makes it ambiguous to define given it’s hard to discern what this epoch will
                    be
                    remembered for in a few hundred years time. The Neoclassicism of the 1700s is as unique and
                    separate
                    from the Romanticism and Realism of the 1800s. I only hope that the large canvas of painted
                    stripes
                    does
                    not go down as century defining work.
                    <br><br>
                    It got me thinking what is the purpose of Art. Should it be conformist, contentious, byzantine?
                    The
                    exhibition I saw was about celebrating the monotony of everyday life. That’s why it included
                    many
                    photos
                    of household items, populated streets, and shop windows. This would be a captivating collection
                    had
                    it
                    been in any other location but London.
                    <br><br>
                    It raises the question: does art exist to highlight what we overlook, or is it meant to
                    transcend
                    the
                    ordinary? An exhibition like this could be fascinating in a more remote, serene setting, where
                    the
                    everyday life on display might contrast sharply with the viewer’s experience of the
                    surroundings.
                    But in
                    London, it risks becoming part of the noise, a reflection of what’s already outside the gallery
                    walls.
                    <br><br>
                    In that sense, art’s purpose becomes layered: it can be conformist, capturing and celebrating
                    life
                    as it
                    is, contentious, challenging our assumptions and provoking thought, or byzantine, complex and
                    difficult
                    to unravel. But perhaps, like this exhibition, it can also be a mirror, inviting us to see the
                    overlooked beauty or dullness in our own routines—turning the ordinary into something worth
                    contemplating.
                    <br><br>
                    Damn it. I wasn’t that impressed with the art but the fact that it has garnered this level of
                    analysis,
                    answers my question of the purpose of the art on display.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto more impressive sights. The Globe Theatre tour was as magical as expected. The afternoon
                    matinee
                    performance of The Comedy of Errors had just concluded which meant the team were dismantling the
                    set
                    to
                    prepare for the evening show of Hansel & Gretel. The guide was an all access pass to the Globe,
                    teaching
                    us about the history and the architecture which makes the plays come to life. This is the third
                    Globe
                    Theatre; only opening in 1997. The project was spearheaded by Sam Wanamaker who was an actor and
                    director, but mainly a Shakespeare aficionado. Wanamaker accumulated the funds from wealthy
                    supporters
                    and benefactors and immortalised their largesse by engraving their names in the concrete slabs
                    outside
                    the Theatre. Some notable names include Lawrence Olivier, Alfred Hitchcock, Maggie Smith, Dame
                    Judi
                    Dench, and Kenneth Branagh. Wanamaker was quite ingenuitive. He went down the phone book and
                    called
                    everyone with the surname of Shakespeare asking for donations. Unsurprisingly, most supported
                    the
                    cause
                    as it meant they could be a part of history.
                    <br><br>
                    Taking a break from my cultural activities, it was time for pool and a catchup with Matthew. The
                    mechanics which I learnt from snooker served me well. This is how I expected the Pool Tournament
                    to
                    go
                    during freshers but was instead greeted with bent cues and unsportsmanlike behaviour from my
                    opponent.
                    After a bite to eat, Matthew gave me a tour around the Barbican and then we hit the pubs. I say
                    this
                    everytime I visit London but the people who live there don’t realise how lucky they are to have
                    everything right on their doorstep. Culture, musicals, plays, tourist attractions, architecture,
                    palaces, parks, skyscrapers, castles, and Shakespeare. It’s probably best that I don’t live
                    there
                    yet,
                    otherwise I would bankrupt myself by seeing every play under the sun.

                <h2>Thursday, 10th October</h2>
                <p>
                    After my indulgent spending spree on Tuesday night (yes, that blog was an allegory about my
                    reckless
                    shopping), today brought the stark realisation that my dilemma lies in want, not need. While
                    some
                    purchases were necessities, the more extravagant ones—the McLaren F1 hoodie, the Levi's
                    jeans—were
                    better returned. My frugal instincts, once again, saved me from myself. Yet, there’s nothing
                    more
                    déclassé than walking back into the stores where, just days earlier, I had proudly parted with a
                    large
                    chunk of my net worth, only to ask for refunds. I could feel the judgement in the cashier's
                    eyes.
                    <br><br>
                    One particularly irksome trend emerged: the disappearance of the physical card swipe in the
                    refund
                    process. At each store, they processed the refund remotely, without me even tapping my card.
                    Unacceptable! I want visual confirmation! Either the reassuring beep or preferably dollar signs
                    floating
                    through the air! The clear sign that my money is being returned. Instead, I’m met with the
                    assurances of
                    the cashier who has no obligation to spare me from their mendacity. “Your refund will be back in
                    your
                    account in three to five days.” Will it? I suppose I have no choice but to trust you then.
                    <br><br>
                    Putting this behind me, it was time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Leicester. Hello the bright
                    lights
                    of London. First on the agenda: SIX! The Musical. Immediately, time was against me as I rushed
                    to
                    the
                    Vaudeville Theatre as the train was inevitably delayed. The musical was about the six ex-wives
                    of
                    Henry
                    VIII and offered a refreshing format when compared to other musicals. Instead of telling a
                    story,
                    reliving their lives, it was similar to a concert with each character trying to persuade the
                    audience
                    that they were the most memorable wife. Complete with audience interaction and individual solos,
                    I
                    would
                    recommend it to everyone. I thought the short runtime would hinder it but instead it enriches
                    everything, giving it a brisk pace that keeps everyone engaged and entertained from start to
                    finish.
                    Each performance is a burst of energy, drawing you in with catchy tunes and clever lyrics.
                    Similar
                    to
                    Hamilton, its purpose is to teach children about history whilst incorporating modern references;
                    joking
                    about the patriarchy and commenting on the male hegemony of today. It is critically well
                    received
                    for
                    these reasons as well as passing the Bechdel test which most musicals tend to fail.*
                    <br><br>
                    After a brief photography session with my new zoom lens, capturing the London skyline between
                    the
                    Vaudeville Theatre and the Globe Theatre, I transitioned from reliving the embellished history
                    of
                    Henry
                    VIII in the early sixteenth century to exploring the world of Shakespeare in the late sixteenth
                    century.
                    Liam was just as ebullient to be spending a night watching Shakespeare, which he showed by
                    heading
                    straight to the bar to indulge in red wine before we took our seats. The Comedy of Errors, a
                    classic
                    tale of mistaken identity, intrigue, and the complexities of love… the paragon of Shakespearean
                    Literature. It’s about two sets of identical twins who are separated at birth and accidentally
                    reunited
                    through a series of fortunate circumstances. The ensuing chaos leads to comedic situations,
                    wrongful
                    accusations, and of course, a joyful reunion. This certainly wasn’t a tragedy.
                    <br><br>
                    The Globe wasn’t sold out but still boasted a good turnout for a cold October evening. When I go
                    again
                    in the future, I will be sure to put extra layers on. Tonight, Liam graciously supplied me with
                    a
                    woolly
                    jumper as I was expecting the same warm temperatures I was enjoying in Leicester but ended up
                    freezing
                    instead. Two hours of laughs, shenanigans and tomfoolery, the players took their final bow and
                    it
                    was
                    time to go. Time to have a rough night’s sleep on Liam’s floor.

                    *The Bechdel Test is a simple measure of female representation in fiction, requiring that a work
                    features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.

                <p>
                    Soar Point was buzzing as ever. The raucous thrills of students from all faculties, enjoying the
                    camaraderie of their respective societies. The Women's Champions League games, which garnered a
                    larger
                    crowd than I would have expected in a student bar, were displayed on every screen. Each table
                    was
                    lined
                    with benches and discounted menus to accommodate the extra influx of customers. Personally, I
                    don’t
                    know
                    much about Women’s football. The runners who I was with, shared a passing interest but their
                    enthusiasm
                    wavered once the conversation moved off Lionesses Euro Campaign. While it was a successful night
                    for
                    Manchester City who won against Barcelona, Arsenal didn’t share the same glory, being huminited
                    5-2.
                    When the fourth goal went in, that’s when the uproar started. A group of supporters couldn’t
                    contain
                    their disappointment and as one would expect from a footballing crowd, unleashed a diatribe of
                    abuse
                    at
                    the screens. It was no different from what can be heard at a men’s game but because it was
                    Women’s
                    football and the pub was filled with students, many disapproved of the misogynistic epithets.
                    Still,
                    I
                    didn’t think it was anything egregious so continued my conversation with the runners. Five
                    minutes
                    later, the fans were being escorted out of the pub; followed by the owner’s statement,
                    apologising
                    for
                    an offence which people might have suffered. I was in disbelief. I guess that’s the level we’re
                    at
                    here.
                    I best not bring out my best Bernard Manning impressions or Jimmy Carr jokes. Soft tarts.

                <h2>Tuesday, 8th October</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me tell you a story. It’s about a man; tall, debonair, a true gentleman with a penchant for
                    fine
                    things. He carried himself with the grace of nobility, believing firmly that a man’s mood and
                    fortune
                    were shaped, in no small part, by how he presented himself to the world. His garments, he
                    believed,
                    were
                    a reflection of his spirit, and so he took great care to adorn himself in the finest cloth that
                    gold
                    could buy.
                    <br><br>
                    This man, though refined and prudent in most affairs, was not immune to the whims of vanity, and
                    the
                    allure of luxury tugged often at his heart. One evening, word reached him of a rare event—a
                    grand
                    market, closed to the commoners, where only those of youthful vigour and standing might enter.
                    It
                    was
                    whispered that the best merchants of the realm would offer their goods at prices so low, they
                    defied
                    reason. A nobleman's wardrobe for a tradesman’s coin.
                    <br><br>
                    To make the market more tempting for these young souls, the guilds set forth amusements to
                    capture
                    their
                    fancies. There was music, lively as a royal ball, played by minstrels who stood high on a dais
                    in
                    the
                    midst of the square. Brightly coloured pennants flapped in the evening air, strewn across the
                    market
                    stalls like the banners of a noble tournament. It was like a merry festival, yet strange, for no
                    guiding
                    hand of elder or master was there to rein in the wild spirit of youth. For but two hours, these
                    apprentices had free reign to barter, trade, and snatch up the finest wares at unheard-of
                    discounts,
                    as
                    if time itself had been turned to favour them.
                    <br><br>
                    Into this revelry strode our protagonist; a man no different from his peers, eyes wide at the
                    splendour
                    and goods displayed before him. He had no thought of thrift or restraint, for such a night comes
                    but
                    seldom, and never again might such bargains be offered. So, as though possessed by a strange
                    frenzy,
                    he
                    dashed from one stall to the next, his purse jingling with the coin he had saved.
                    <br><br>
                    He purchased fine woollen breeches, velvet doublets fit for a nobleman, a grand leather jerkin,
                    and
                    even
                    a hooded cloak emblazoned with the crest of a famous knightly order. Each piece he bought with
                    little
                    thought, for the prices, they said, were far lower than any would find on a common market day.
                    And
                    so,
                    laden with goods, he strode back to his quarters, a triumphant smile upon his face.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, as the moon rose higher in the sky, and the frenzy of the fair faded, the young man sat
                    amidst
                    his
                    newly acquired riches and began to reckon his coin. He gazed in his reflection; in awe at his
                    sartorial
                    elegance for it was then that a troubling thought took root. He had spent far more than he had
                    ever
                    intended. What use had he for so many fine garments? Could he truly afford to keep all that he
                    had
                    purchased? And indeed, did he even need such luxuries, when simpler wares might serve him just
                    as
                    well?
                    <br><br>
                    And thus, my friends, this tale stands as a caution to all. For even the sharpest mind can be
                    dulled
                    by
                    the glitter of a fleeting bargain, and in the rush to seize every treasure, one may return home
                    burdened
                    with far more than they need—or can pay for. Better to be the one who walks the fair with a
                    discerning
                    eye and a steady hand, rather than the one who staggers away with empty pockets and full
                    regrets.
                    After
                    all, it’s not the abundance of fine things that brings satisfaction, but the wisdom to leave
                    behind
                    what
                    you never truly needed.
                    <br><br>
                    Hopefully, you can deduce the allegory behind that story. I’m sure the more perceptive folk will
                    pick up
                    on the deeper meaning. Or perhaps, much like the man in the story, you’ve been swept up in my
                    fine
                    words
                    and now find yourself sitting there wondering, "Wait… what was the point again?" But fear
                    not—unlike
                    the
                    man, at least you didn’t spend anything and it was only time you wasted!

                <h2>Monday, 7th October</h2>
                <p>
                    Waking up at five in the morning does not do anything to improve my productivity for the day. If
                    anything, it stymies motivation. I struggle to sleep because of a number of factors. One: my
                    mind is
                    too
                    active with developing mobile apps. I’m thinking of all the opportunities which become available
                    once I
                    complete this module. Two: my duvet is two thick for these warm autumn evenings. Opening my
                    window
                    is
                    not an option to counteract this because the incessant sirens are insufferable. Three: my
                    mattress
                    is
                    springy - and not in a good way. Four: There are too many things happening at the moment for me
                    to
                    get
                    an early night anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    So what do I do if I can’t comfortably get back to sleep? Well, I start reading, which is futile
                    because
                    I haven’t had enough REM sleep which means the part of the brain which consolidates memory is
                    not
                    working efficiently. Thus when I awake a few hours later, I will have forgotten the pages I’ve
                    covered.
                    Option two is to persist in trying to sleep which is rarely successful. Lastly, I will start
                    coding.
                    This normally means I’ve given up on sleep and am ready to start the day… at five in the
                    morning.
                    Call
                    it productive or an auspicious start to the day. It takes its toll on me when it comes to the
                    evening
                    activities when I am struggling to keep my eyes open. I have sacrificed running with the group
                    tonight
                    and cancelled my place in Pilates. All because I am sleep deprived. I need to do something to
                    fix
                    this.

                <p>
                    Bollocks. I’ve made the Futsal team. After my poor performance during the trials on Friday
                    night, I
                    thought it would be a long shot to assume that I’ll be selected. Obviously, the coach had a few
                    laudatory voices chirping in his ear convincing him that I’m worth the gamble. As previously
                    mentioned,
                    I have a busy schedule with all the other activities and societies I want to be involved in.
                    Ideally,
                    futsal would just be a social event where I could pick and choose the sessions which I wanted to
                    attend.
                    This news certainly has complicated a few things. There is no rush to decide as I don’t need to
                    pay
                    the
                    sign-up fee for a few weeks, therefore my plan is to stick to my timetable prioritising Hackers
                    and
                    Demon Media and see how many free evenings I can spare after those commitments. Futsal doesn’t
                    embellish
                    my CV which is why it’s third in my pecking order. Irrespective of my dilemma, I am honoured to
                    be
                    selected; knowing that my skill is being recognised.

                    What brings together, transgender people, ex-drug addicts, insomniacs, non-binaries, and
                    schizophrenia
                    patients. That’s right. The Media society. The home to the society outcasts basking in solitude.
                    Everyone as uniquely protuberant as the next. These people have taken the time out of their day,
                    exited
                    their caves, to grace us with their presence to join the new intake of Demon Media. “Write what
                    you
                    know,” was the advice the current editor-in-chief told us. Hardly a niche magazine then but if
                    the
                    possibilities are endless with little moderation or censorship, this magazine is going to be a
                    mix
                    between Orwell’s ‘nineteen eighty-four’ and Freud’s ‘The Psychopathology of Everyday Life’. Out
                    of
                    the
                    three strands of Media, I am focusing on Radio and the Magazine. Enough to learn new skills but
                    not
                    dominate all of my time.
                    <br><br>
                    For the record, that’s Futsal, Running, Karting, Hackers, Demon Media, Racing and Pilates all
                    happening
                    alongside my studies. There are also cultural exchange classes which look appealing which run
                    from
                    November to March which serve as a good additional qualification to complete after my Erasmus
                    year.
                    With
                    all of these extra curriculars, it will be impossible to keep up to date with everything so some
                    will
                    have to be demoted to occasional outings. Competitive futsal is looking less and less likely
                    since I
                    have access to free sessions when I have time anyway at the Watershed. The trial this evening
                    went
                    poorly too so I’ll see if I even make the team. At the end, I was still asked what my number was
                    so
                    there may be hope yet. I think I’m being picked from reputation alone. After gaining the
                    nickname
                    ‘Cold
                    Palmer’ by the players already on the team, it’s evident I showed some skill in previous
                    sessions to
                    gain such a reputable moniker.
                    <br><br>
                    Irrespective of the outcome this evening, Monday evenings are also reserved for Pilates. It’s
                    four
                    days
                    on and I can still feel my abs flaring up when I sit up in the morning. Karting will likely take
                    a
                    back
                    seat too; partly because it’s expensive to participate and very time consuming. I can still take
                    part in
                    the society socials at Soar point to watch the F1 races on the weekend which I’m fervently
                    waiting
                    for.
                    <br><br>
                    PS. The camera lens which I bought off ebay on Wednesday evening arrived five days earlier than
                    expected. First inspections have revealed no conspicuous faults but we’ll see when I go for my
                    first
                    photography session this weekend. Everything seems to be falling into place auspiciously.

                <h2>Thursday, 3rd October</h2>
                <p>
                    Bit of a disconcerting atmosphere in the building today. Similar to a heavy pall lingering over
                    a
                    city.
                    It started off as a normal day; all was well. That was until a resident overdosed in the common
                    room. I
                    don’t know the symptoms of an overdose or what one looks like outside of the flicks, but from
                    the
                    detailed descriptions I got from my friends on the ground floor, it sounds similar to a seizure.
                    I’m
                    not
                    sure who was with her at the time or what was taken, but by this evening, the Rashomon effect
                    had
                    truly
                    taken hold, and I was hearing all forms of speculation. Was she suicidal? Was it a cry for help?
                    Was
                    she
                    spiked? Was it an accident? From the tales I’ve heard today, it’s similar to a creative writing
                    assignment I did in Stockholm where we were given the end of a short story and we needed to
                    write
                    the
                    beginning. Each story is different, with complex characters and embellished storylines. The only
                    definitive fact I know is that someone overdosed. Current status unknown. End of.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto a lighter topic. On my perpetual quest for social interaction this year, I had another
                    society
                    gathering this evening: DMU Hackers. The one I’ve been most anticipating. Relevant to Comp.
                    Science
                    by
                    association, though not directly included in my course modules. Dilan was genuinely pleased to
                    see
                    me
                    when I stepped out of the elevator. I think a friendly face was all he needed since he was
                    running
                    the
                    society this year. Given his extensive knowledge in Cyber Security, he is more than qualified.
                    In
                    addition to the culmination of his placement year at IBM, he could pass for a lecturer now. I
                    won’t
                    bore
                    you with the ins and outs of the meeting, but it was great fun, and I regret not participating
                    in
                    previous years. If only I were more confident…
                    <br><br>
                    We concluded the meeting with a visit to Soar Point, the campus sports bar, which I am starting
                    to
                    become a frequent visitor through the different societies. Mehmet, Natalia’s boyfriend, was
                    there
                    with a
                    few of his engineering friends who he introduced me to. Some I already had the pleasure of
                    speaking
                    with
                    at the DMU Racing brief. These are the lads who will hopefully be teaching me how to build an
                    engine. I
                    just need to manage my time effectively so I have enough bandwidth to take part in all these
                    extracurriculars. My current thought process is omitting Futsal from my schedule and only doing
                    a
                    session a week instead of the competitive league for which I have been scouted. The trial is
                    tomorrow
                    evening, so I’ll update you on how that plans out. Though the first Demon Media society meeting
                    starts
                    at six, so I’ll have to think of a crafty excuse to account for my premature exit. See what I
                    mean
                    about
                    my busy schedule…

                    I’m a thief. Well, actually, a fraudster would be a more accurate description. Remember those
                    Asics
                    running trainers which were half a size too big? Well, after a five-minute cleanup job and a
                    steady
                    hand
                    attaching the tags again, I have managed to fool the Sports Direct staff into thinking they were
                    unworn.
                    That’s right—a pair of running trainers which I ran 5k in while it rained, plus an active
                    Pilates
                    session straight afterward, and I’ve exchanged them for a pair which is half a size smaller. I
                    almost
                    feel guilty, but my acuity towards subterfuge is to be admired.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto my academic endeavors for the day. After the unchallenging lecture and practical session
                    yesterday,
                    and consultation with Dillan, I have persuaded my course leader to allow me to switch to Mobile
                    App
                    Development. Therefore, I am not repeating the same module which I completed in second year.
                    Also,
                    this
                    means I get to have classes with Dilan, which is always a huge benefit. Why not just stick to
                    Big
                    Data
                    and Machine Learning since you’ve already got the finished coursework, I hear you ask? Well,
                    even
                    though
                    I achieved a first in the module last time out, I actually want to learn a new programming
                    language
                    and
                    get a modicum of experience in the mobile development industry. To be honest, I despised
                    operating
                    the
                    infrastructure which DMU employed to handle Big Data databases, so I didn’t want to put myself
                    through
                    that again. Also, the Kotlin programming language is so intuitive; I practically already know it
                    from
                    learning its derivatives.

                    After a long-anticipated wait, Jimmy Carr has finally come to Leicester. We managed to snag
                    tickets
                    for
                    the half-nine showing—me, Natalia, and Natalia’s boyfriend, Mehmet, who happens to be a really
                    nice
                    guy.
                    The show was as expected, with insults, heckles, and banter. Very funny. The audience
                    participation
                    is a
                    must because I felt like snappy one-liners get tiresome after a while. The spontaneity of the
                    audience
                    is what makes it unique. Though there were a lot of jokes which I have seen him perform before
                    on
                    YouTube, etc. When the audience shouts a heckle relating to his tax affairs, he has the same
                    choreographed routine to defend himself. Also, rehearsed clapbacks when asked about Trump,
                    Biden,
                    Starmer, Epstein... I heard him do one joke which I first heard him perform on an episode of
                    <em>Eight
                        Out
                        of Ten Cats</em> in 2019. Nevertheless, it was a great evening, and I would recommend
                    everyone go to
                    watch
                    him at least once.

                    The society group chats have been in full swing today. The Racing Society has been talking about
                    F1
                    for
                    six hours now—and I love it. There are around seventy members, each with a fervent opinion about
                    the
                    status quo in the driver championship. I occasionally throw in an obviously contentious point of
                    view
                    just to rattle a few people. I know—I’m a prick. I am also part of the Running group chat, which
                    is
                    home
                    dominantly to last night’s joggers complaining about their aches and pains. I’m in the same boat
                    as
                    them, but I’m stoic and don’t publicly announce my weaknesses.
                    <br><br>
                    A dark horse society which I’ve joined is the Doctor Who Society. There are only a handful of us
                    in
                    the
                    group chat, so I don’t know what level of participation I am going to achieve. Call me
                    old-fashioned,
                    but 40% of the members identify as ‘they,’ and they have already given me negative first
                    impressions—either from their kowtowing to other group members to hammer home their pronouns or
                    their
                    Calvinistic approach to running a society. A personal pet peeve of mine, and I know it’s
                    nitpicky:
                    people who don’t use proper grammar or spelling when texting. I don’t mind abbreviations, but
                    individuals who say ‘I fought’ instead of ‘I thought’ are clearly Satanists. That is a speech
                    impediment; therefore, they have no excuse to extend that poor vocabulary into the medium of
                    text.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving away from societies, I had my first timetabled lecture and practical today. Having made
                    my
                    notes
                    yesterday, this introductory session was nothing strenuous. The first Big Data and Machine
                    Learning
                    lecture was no hardship. The most discerning thing I learned is that out of a class of
                    approximately
                    one
                    hundred students, 71% had never used the Python programming language. These are Computer Science
                    students! As I have already done two Big Data modules (one at DMU in second year and one in
                    Stockholm),
                    I should be an expert at machine learning algorithms. I must not get complacent; I must not get
                    complacent; I must not get complacent.

                    The biggest hardship I faced this morning, technologically speaking, is trying to get my Linux
                    laptop
                    connected to the DMU WiFi. After thirty minutes debugging myself and a further thirty-five
                    minutes
                    with
                    a crestfallen IT officer in the library, I finally connected. I am the first student he has
                    helped
                    who
                    has faced this problem in thirteen years. Speaking on the phone to the IT staff in Gateway
                    House, he
                    was
                    elucidating the need for updated documentation so these problems don’t reoccur. Also, in that
                    conversation, I was referred to as ‘a gentleman of discernment and taste’ when it comes to
                    operating
                    systems.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I’m off to the DSU to participate in the pièce de résistance of my fresher's journey—the
                    event
                    which
                    I have been preparing for since March: the pool tournament.

                    The DMU Global trips have been released. During my time here at university, I have made the most
                    of
                    these trips—first going to Bilbao and then spending a year in Stockholm. This year is my final
                    year,
                    so
                    I obviously don’t want anything to clash; however, it looks like the majority of trips are
                    happening
                    during the first week of Easter, which is convenient. There are a few that have caught my eye:
                    Berlin,
                    Salzburg, Dublin. Unfortunately, they are not available to my faculty. There are several trips
                    in
                    the
                    extracurricular category which are applicable to me: employment workshops in Paris and culture
                    in
                    Alicante. I would be happy with attending either. I have been to Spain a lot in the past few
                    years,
                    but
                    I cannot turn down the opportunity to practice my Spanish. Alternatively, I have been looking at
                    going
                    to Paris for a while, and this would give me ample opportunity to see all the sights. All trips
                    are
                    five
                    days long, but the bursary applied to each varies. The opportunities I am eying up will cost me
                    around
                    £200, which is very good since accommodation and flights are included.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the academic year started today, the remaining freshers' activities are taking place
                    almost
                    every
                    evening this week. I am not a drinker nor a clubber, so I don’t have much planned this week. The
                    pool
                    tournament I have been practicing for is taking place tomorrow night, marking the end of my
                    freshers.
                    Most of the societies have their first meetings or activities this week, so my evenings are
                    almost
                    all
                    booked up anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening, for instance, I was running with the group. We were doing laps around a track.
                    Lauren
                    is
                    the pace setter, as she can run a mile in around 6.30 minutes. In total, we covered an
                    accumulated
                    5k,
                    which is a nice round number. Upon finally running in my new trainers, I have come to the
                    conclusion
                    that they are actually half a size too big for me. If I am duplicitous enough, I will clean them
                    up
                    and
                    try to return them. Though that might be too devious even for a man with my flexible moral
                    compass.
                    <br><br>
                    After running, I had Pilates booked at the Watershed. I hadn’t eaten anything in five hours, my
                    muscles
                    ached, my groin was tight, and my thigh was on the verge of being pulled. I was satisfied with
                    the
                    exercise I had done for the day and was ready to shower and crawl into bed, but Kyra, one of the
                    runners, persuaded me to attend since she didn’t want to go alone. Having completed a couple of
                    yoga
                    sessions, I was expecting much of the same. In truth, there were a lot of similar moves;
                    however,
                    Pilates focused more on core exercises. Instead of completing them until you hit your rep
                    target,
                    the
                    purpose is to control each movement and take your time, many of which activated my abs more than
                    any
                    workout session in the past. Despite my trepidation, it felt like it soothed my aches and pains;
                    though
                    now, I have the added addition of stinging abs along with painful legs when I wake tomorrow.

                    Treachery! I have just found out that ‘Fear Her’ has been removed from BBC iPlayer because that
                    episode
                    contains scenes with the disgraced Hugh Edwards. Doctor Who is well-known for including real
                    newsreaders
                    or presenters to increase the verisimilitude and Britishness of the show. While this contributes
                    to
                    its
                    charm, it also means the show is subject to the ever-shifting landscape of BBC politics, which
                    the
                    corporation must carefully navigate. Since Edwards' declasse status, the Beeb has rightly cut
                    ties
                    with
                    him, but that means that any programs he has appeared in need to be removed from the public
                    domain.
                    Alas, even episodes where he only features for a meagre few seconds. You would think the
                    higher-ups
                    at
                    the Beeb would tactfully dub the scenes or even recut the episodes given the popularity of the
                    show,
                    but
                    no. Hitherto, season two of Doctor Who is missing a much-loved episode…
                    <br><br>
                    Moving onto a less contentious part of my day, after last night’s festivities, I am walking
                    around
                    zombie-like today. Anything less than the required eight hours of sleep gives me headaches.
                    Nevertheless, I trekked to Abbey Park to partake in the final fresher event and to round off a
                    very
                    successful week of acclimatising to life back in Leicester. ‘Park Life’, as it is advertised,
                    was
                    supposed to be a carnival-type affair with games, activities, crafts, and sports—mediums to help
                    the
                    new
                    intake mix and socialise. Arriving at midday, an hour into these events, I was greeted with a
                    rather
                    lacklustre show of DSU ambassadors and a scarcely filled park. Only a small group of students
                    decided to
                    show up, meaning the overall success of the event was wavering. It’s one of those things which
                    takes
                    mass participation for the event to be successful. Despite the event being ‘sold out’ on the DSU
                    website, the actual turnout was met with general apathy, so I made a premature exit and had my
                    first
                    relaxing day to myself, where I could watch the football and catch up on my reading.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, Natalia has booked the tickets to see Jimmy Carr after consulting Mehmet. I have
                    been
                    watching this venue for a while, so it’s good to finally have it booked. Alas, now I just need
                    to
                    try
                    and fit it into my busy schedule.

                <h2>Saturday, 28th September</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first day which I have no DMU activities or sports on. Thankfully, instead of
                    rattling
                    around my room for the day, I do have a few errands to run. After doing the weekly shop at the
                    big
                    Tesco, I also picked up a few extra things for Octavia’s party tonight. It’s the first time
                    meeting
                    up
                    with Emily and Natalia since before leaving for Stockholm so I am euphorically looking forward
                    to
                    it. Of
                    course, Saturday’s are reserved for football and with Nana’s VirginGo installed on my iPad, this
                    makes
                    it significantly easier rather than finding a dodgy stream that doesn’t buffer. Pleased with
                    Middlesbrough’s two nil win over Stoke, I watched another film which had been on my watch list
                    since
                    its
                    release: Miller’s Girl.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a low-budget flick, written by a writer with credits in the MCU and DC world but this was
                    her
                    first stand-alone film which she also directed. Ignoring the low ratings on IMDB, I thought it
                    was
                    enjoyable. Nothing too spectacular, but as a writer, I appreciate the quality vocabulary used in
                    the
                    film. Facilely, the story follows the life of a student (Jenna Ortega) who takes inspiration
                    from
                    her
                    English Professor's book and uses it in her college thesis. The issue is that the Professor’s
                    book
                    contains an erotic scene and the student focuses entirely on that scene - writing fictitiously
                    what
                    could happen between the student and the professor. I actually enjoyed it though it may be
                    because
                    it is
                    based around writing and the narrative using a varied lexicon instead of the mundane vernacular
                    which
                    appeals to the mass market. Martin Freeman and Jenna Ortega are personal favourites of mine too.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving onto the festivities this evening. I wasn’t told that it was Octavia’s birthday on Monday
                    till
                    very late into the evening. Honestly, when they were bringing out the cake, it should have been
                    a
                    giveaway but still I was ignorant of the fact. Natalia has continued working for the lecturer as
                    a
                    research assistant which she was with for the majority of her final year. She did think about
                    doing
                    a
                    PhD but ultimately opted against it. Technically, she is taking a gap year to get more
                    experience
                    doing
                    research as that is what she hopes to be doing in the future. As it is a paltry wage; she is
                    still
                    working at Starbucks on the weekend but as a manager now. Emily and Octavia work in the same
                    care
                    facility, helping children with learning difficulties through the medium of drama. Very noble
                    indeed
                    but
                    it does suit their empathetic need to help people.
                    <br><br>
                    Natalia’s boyfriend was there: Mehmet, who coincidentally, I had already met at the futsal
                    session
                    yesterday. Small world huh. He is doing engineering and is part of the Racing Society which I’ve
                    signed
                    up to. I guess I’ll be seeing a lot of him. Good thing, he’s such a laid back type of person.
                    Emily
                    and
                    Taves’ brothers also turned up; Mikey and Tobey who are good fun to be around. Mikey is 23 and
                    works
                    in
                    a zoo. Toby is slightly more reserved but he is only 18 and starting UOL next week. I was the
                    oldest
                    in
                    the room; a fact which I didn’t think bothered me but as I’ve had pointed out to me this week,
                    this
                    is
                    starting to be a common occurrence. We played a lot of board games and a few party type games
                    like
                    charades. All good fun of course. Living in the building attached to Highcross is very
                    convenient
                    because it is a short walk through the shopping mall to get to their flat, however at two
                    o’clock in
                    the
                    morning, I needed to add another fifteen minutes onto the journey, walking the circumference of
                    the
                    buildings.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhausted, I was in bed and asleep by three o’clock. My springy bed isn’t as big an issue as I
                    initially
                    thought. Accordingly, when you’re tired enough, you’ll sleep anywhere. After the busy week I’ve
                    had,
                    it’s not surprising that I haven’t had time to complain!

                <h2>Friday, 27th September</h2>
                <p>
                    After a busy four days meeting and greeting new people, today can be classed as a quasi day off.
                    There
                    is a ‘fun day’ at the DSU but based on the description of the event online, it sounds
                    uninteresting
                    and
                    just a ploy in order to put another event on the schedule in order to make the purchase of the
                    freshers
                    wristbands seem good value. For the sole purpose of getting me out of the flat, I played
                    football
                    instead. As it was mid-afternoon, it was a much quieter session but the skill level was
                    distinctly
                    higher. This could be considered a training session for the DMU Futsal team because there were
                    so
                    many
                    already distinguished players in the game. Nevertheless, I held my own. Scored a couple,
                    assisted a
                    few
                    more. Try-outs will be interesting.
                    <br><br>
                    Came home to find my room had been broken into. Just kidding. The plumber had let himself in to
                    fix
                    the
                    leaky toilet. The push button had too much pressure on it so he replaced the full body. He
                    shares
                    similar views to me about Leicester. As he’s an Aussie, he only travels into Leicester for work
                    but
                    couldn’t live here. If it wasn’t for his wife, he would be moving back to Australia. He’s the
                    first
                    person I’ve met too who speaks complimentary about the British weather. After he was done, I had
                    the
                    rest of the day to myself. ‘Miss Sloane’ has been on my watchlist forever so I finally had the
                    time
                    to
                    sit down and enjoy it. No football is on tonight so I just relaxed feeling ebullient about my
                    successful
                    freshers week.

                <h2>Thursday, 26th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the same societies were occupying the DSU building, I was going to miss the final day of
                    freshers
                    since I have already signed up for half a dozen societies and clubs. However, the gentle
                    persuasion
                    of
                    Hannah changed my mind. I met up with her and her friend Zed and checked out the DSU. Due to the
                    declining interest, a number of societies decided the third day wasn’t worth it so the tables
                    were
                    only
                    occupying two floors, not three. Since almost everyone I’ve met this week is doing English
                    Literature or
                    some other form of Humanities, I have plenty in common with them. Zed is a facsimile of me from
                    first
                    year. Very taciturn and when she does speak, it’s laconic and meticulous. If she could have it
                    her
                    way,
                    she would be getting dragged around freshers by Hannah. Anyway, afterwards we had a brief lunch
                    from
                    one
                    of the stalls. It was very insipid food which is to be expected from makeshift food stalls. I
                    bade
                    farewell as I wanted to play football this afternoon and needed to get back to change.
                    <br><br>
                    All the sessions at the Watershed are still part of the ‘taster experience’ therefore are free
                    and
                    no
                    need to book. This is perhaps a hindrance rather than a benefit when thirty people show up to
                    play
                    in a
                    meagre sized hall. The lads present were the same few who persuaded me to join the trials so
                    they
                    were
                    easy to talk to. Because of the vast interest, more than half the allotted time my team sat on
                    the
                    bench. Nevermind. Some of the current futsal team were there and they were scouting new talent.
                    <br><br>
                    After a quick shower and a brisk walk back to the Watershed, I partook in my second yoga session
                    of
                    the
                    week. In the normal timetable, Yoga will clash with the DMU Hackers meetings on Thursday nights
                    so
                    I’m
                    the epitome of ‘here for a good time, not a long time’ type thing. There was much more interest
                    in
                    this
                    session which is understandable now everyone is finding their feet around campus. Francesca
                    messaged
                    me
                    as the class was finishing saying she was running late. Poor time-management is clearly one of
                    her
                    faults as she missed the entirety of the session. This could be perceived as divine intervention
                    because
                    I was caught in a thunderstorm on the way home. After camping out in the Watershed for ten
                    minutes,
                    it
                    showed no signs of passing. Bravely wrapping up, I ran back to St Martins House but I was
                    rightly
                    soaked
                    through. I do hope I don’t get a cold.

                <h2>Wednesday, 25th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Before attending day two of the freshers fair, I picked up more essentials from town. Instead of
                    doing
                    one big shop, I’ve been doing it in stages. I also had another purpose for visiting town today:
                    running
                    trainers. I had been scouting the shops up north, but they were too dear, as Nana would say.
                    Here, I
                    have dedicated running shops and other independent retailers, which brought me an extended
                    selection.
                    The problem was, the prices skyrocketed in these retailers. Alas, I went to Sports Direct, even
                    though I
                    don’t like to support Mike Ashley. I managed to snag a pair of Asics for £64, which I think is
                    reasonable. As long as I don’t go mad shopping in the next few weeks, I’ll be able to amortise
                    the
                    cost
                    from the largesse of the parents.
                    <br><br>
                    The freshers fair was not as popular today compared to yesterday. The DSU was just as busy with
                    societies, but the interest from the students had subsided. As promised, Dilan was there at the
                    DMU
                    Hackers table. We had a brief but interesting catch-up. He’s still at IBM until the end of the
                    week,
                    so
                    it’s almost guaranteed that he’ll have a job after graduating. The Hackers meetings happen
                    weekly,
                    normally in Gateway House. Currently, that isn’t a problem, but during the second semester, I
                    might
                    have
                    a seminar overlapping. Problem for later.
                    <br><br>
                    The most fortunate meeting of the day was seeing the stall for DMU Runners. This is a society
                    that
                    simply goes running together. Since I’ve just bought new Asics this morning, I thought it was
                    prudent to
                    have a chat with them. Coincidentally, they are meeting at the pub this evening to get to know
                    the
                    new
                    intakes. More on this to come. Being circumspect, I said I’d think about it. That was because I
                    had
                    a
                    previous engagement for this evening: yoga.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s right. I’m turning into a spiritual middle-aged man. I’ll be reading tea leaves and
                    telling
                    fortunes with a crystal ball if I’m not careful. Held at the Watershed, the session had only
                    four
                    others
                    present. Strangely, all women; who’d have thought. The movements were slow and controlled. “It’s
                    all
                    about breathing out the bad energy and inhaling the good energy.” The session was an hour long,
                    and
                    we
                    were doing all the classic poses: downward dog, the chair, deep lunge, the rag doll. Oh yeah,
                    I’ve
                    learnt a lot. We even meditated at the end; however, I admit I did find it difficult not to
                    laugh
                    during
                    the silence at this new-age bollocks. “Focus on your breathing. Breathe in hopes and dreams.
                    Breathe
                    out
                    negativity and impure thoughts.” What? Is this a front for a religious society now too?
                    <br><br>
                    I met Hannah and Francesca at this class. They’re starting their first year, both studying
                    English
                    Literature. Obviously, we had a lot of similar interests and have read almost identical books.
                    Plenty of
                    Dickens and Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.G. Wells, even Shakespeare. Who knows, there may even
                    be
                    hope
                    yet of reciting Shakespeare monologues to each other.
                    <br><br>
                    After a quick shower and a bite to eat, I headed back into town to meet the runners at Soar
                    Point.
                    This
                    is the go-to place for society socials because of the generous deals offered to students and
                    also
                    the
                    large TV screens showing football. The Karting society has an arrangement with the staff to
                    watch
                    the F1
                    there on Sundays too, as long as it doesn’t clash with the football. No doubt, I’ll be a regular
                    if
                    all
                    goes well.
                    <br><br>
                    The Running Society is good fun. There is a good mix of people, boys and girls. Very affable. We
                    played
                    cards and Uno, spoke about our subjects, and shared our hobbies other than running. I was at the
                    head of
                    the table with the committee members: Katie and Lauren, who were the undersecretaries. Tobias,
                    who
                    had
                    graduated last year, is a very funny man and also a paramedic, so he’s a handy friend to have. I
                    was
                    in
                    the Soar till around eleven before we headed out to Firebug, another pub whose USP was offering
                    a
                    retro
                    gaming experience whilst people drink. Mario Karts, Black Ops zombies, MW3. I felt a wave of
                    nostalgia
                    just seeing the consoles. It was just myself and the committee members who ventured to Firebug,
                    as
                    the
                    rest took the long voyage to Black Cats, which was part of the Freshers experience. As a
                    non-drinker, I
                    haven’t invested the £40 in a wristband to get me access to these clubs, but I was content to
                    stay
                    with
                    the runners. I heard the Running Society is well-run. Well run—see what I did there? They have a
                    group
                    running almost every night of the week, so we can pick and choose our days and distances. They
                    also
                    do
                    social runs where they dress up, which will be … eventful.

                <h2>Tuesday, 24th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Mark the date. My first attempt at being sociable. The DSU building was packed from the ground
                    floor
                    to
                    the top with societies and sports teams, all trying to persuade you to join. No wonder I opted
                    to
                    avoid
                    this in past years. This would have been an introvert's worst nightmare, having everyone asking
                    questions and engaging in conversation. Now, however, I welcomed the challenge. After queuing
                    for
                    the
                    best part of an hour to even get in, it was actually enjoyable because I had previously looked
                    online at
                    potential simpatico societies. The stalls I was actively looking for included: DMU Hackers (a
                    computer
                    science society), Karters (a go-karting club that holds socials where they watch F1 together),
                    and
                    Demon
                    Media (the De Montfort magazine and radio proprietors). I thought this triumvirate would be a
                    good
                    place
                    to start.
                    <br><br>
                    Having scoured from top to bottom, I found the latter two but no sign of DMU Hackers.
                    Serendipitously, I
                    ran into Dilan on my way home, who happens to be on the committee. The reason for their absence
                    was
                    due
                    to a lack of space in the building, but they would be there tomorrow.
                    <br><br>
                    The Karters were a passionate bunch, and they all shared simpatico views on F1 as I did. This
                    looks
                    promising. I am less enthusiastic about Demon Media because the quality of the magazine looks
                    mediocre.
                    In conjunction with the poor design and large blank spaces permeating each page, the writing was
                    subpar.
                    I probably sound like Liam when I say that I could do a much more comprehensive job if I were to
                    take
                    over. Similarly to the futsal, I’m not looking for a heavy workload, just a medium in which I
                    can
                    publish a few articles now and again. The first meetings are happening next week, so I will
                    definitely
                    give them a go at least. On my way out, the Futsal society cornered me, and they didn’t let me
                    bypass
                    them without signing up for the trials happening in the next few weeks. It’s nice to be wanted.
                    <br><br>
                    Back at St Martins House, a FIFA tournament was meant to be held, but the staff couldn’t work
                    the
                    TV, so
                    that has been postponed till next week. Nevertheless, I held residence in the common room with a
                    few
                    others, enjoying the conviviality. There were Nigerians, Londoners, Brummies, and me—purposely
                    confusing
                    them all with my northern vernacular. “I canny see the point in gandering about for no reason
                    like”
                    was
                    a personal favourite malapropism of mine. The look of bewilderment on their faces was amusing in
                    itself.
                    Anyway, I have gained a few more followers on Insta, so we can keep in touch. Overall, they seem
                    like
                    good people.

                <h2>Monday, 23rd September</h2>
                <p>
                    The first week of moving into new accommodation is always the most expensive. Stocking up on the
                    essentials plus the weekly shop too, normally brings me to around £50 for the week. I was
                    exhausted
                    for
                    some reason yesterday so I’ve been putting off the shopping and living on bread and the frozen
                    foods
                    which the local Tesco Express stocks. I was carrying out the menial tasks today such as updating
                    my
                    student card and re-registering for the forthcoming year so I was active anyway. The Diamond
                    Jubilee
                    Leisure centre is on the way to the big Tesco’s so I enquired about the free classes available
                    to
                    me.
                    Unbeknownst to me, it was completely the wrong place, leaving the receptionist perplexed about
                    my
                    questions. Turns out, it’s actually the Watershed where the DMU Active session takes place - a
                    DMU
                    owned
                    complex which has dedicated staff which also houses many of the sports societies too.
                    <br><br>
                    Following my productive conversation with the staff, I received a sheet with all the taster
                    sessions
                    on
                    which would be happening throughout freshers. As futsal is the most popular, they are holding
                    four
                    sessions this week so everyone has a chance. No need to sign up or register. Just turn up and
                    play.
                    Simple. The futsal session was eventful. I wanted something relaxed, (if there is such a thing
                    in
                    football), to keep me active throughout the year. Evidently there must have been a few members
                    of
                    the
                    DMU futsal squad there scouting because I’ve been ushered to go to the try-outs. I didn’t
                    particularly
                    think my performance was as good as it normally is but the enthusiasm which the players had when
                    speaking about my skill was too ingratiating for me to say no. I guess I’ll be playing
                    competitive
                    futsal this year…
                    <br><br>
                    My third flatmate moved in today too - Esther. She’s studying microbiology at UOL so I’m not
                    sure
                    how
                    much I’ll see of her. She seems congenial like Summer but I still don’t know how close we are
                    all
                    going
                    to be.

                <h2>Saturday, 21st September</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, the first day of my journey through my final year at university. After bidding adieu to
                    the
                    parents from my new apartment building, I was able to explore. Being located almost centrally to
                    everywhere I go is ideal but the longer journey to the Tesco Superstore may become irksome after
                    a
                    while. But for now, I am satisfied with my room; the bed is springy but it’s one of those things
                    I’ll
                    have to live with. Also from having brief chats with the staff at the reception, this location
                    is
                    normally quiet due to the reduced number of rooms compared to their sister buildings. My only
                    roommate
                    at the moment seems cordial which is all I can ask for at this point. I just hope this
                    ‘university
                    experience’ which I so craved does not come to bite me on the arse because down the road when I
                    have
                    a
                    full apartment.
