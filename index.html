                <h2>Part Sixteen - Concerted? A Little</h2>
                <h5>Saturday, 8th February <strong>13:35 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    We continued our efforts in restoring the furniture that’s building up in the church. I’m doing the
                    menial jobs such as sanding and varnishing. Repeating the same continuous motion becomes relaxing
                    after a while. Almost tranquil and peaceful. Then it had to start raining so the second half of my
                    work detail continued indoors. I’ve been reorganising Silvio’s Shakespeare folios into comedies,
                    tragedies and histories. They’re in Italian but I can deduce which play is which by the title and
                    picture on the front.
                    <br><br>
                    Bet you didn’t know that Shakespeare was merely a public figurehead, while his secret
                    lover—conveniently erased from history—was the <em>true</em> genius behind the plays. At least,
                    that’s the latest gem Silvio has decided to enlighten me with. Now, it’s hardly scandalous to
                    suggest that Shakespeare may have been gay, but to reduce him to some illiterate puppet, a glorified
                    Elizabethan influencer? The sheer ignominy of it! My innate British heritage is screaming; I think
                    I’ve given myself an ulcer from biting my tongue so frequently. How <em>dare</em> he disparage the
                    Bard with such unqualified drivel?
                    <br><br>
                    Sally walks in, interrupting Silvio’s conspiracy lessons, desperation in his voice.
                    <br><br>
                    He explains, <em>“I’ve been seen”.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    A newcomer in the neighbourhood, carrying an expensive-looking camera—an unmistakable red flag. I
                    suppose it was that two-and-a-half hour walk from Tomasso Natale to Palermo centre that put me on
                    the radar. Walking through every neighbourhood, snapping away. I guess that was asinine given the
                    dodgy areas I was wandering through.
                    <br><br>
                    So, in no uncertain terms, I’m ordered not to leave the compound; get Silvio to drive me to the
                    station and text whenever I return so that either he or Sally can collect me. And if I dare to
                    wander around Tommaso Natale, I must ensure it’s glaringly obvious that I’m not carrying a backpack.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio, of course, waves off the warning with his usual insouciance. The world isn’t dangerous,
                    remember? Perhaps to him, with his boundless optimism and questionable past, but I’ve always been
                    one to err on the side of caution. Do I believe Sally’s concerns? I’m unsure. Part of me thinks it’s
                    all performative theatrics, a melodrama put on for the benefit of an impressionable outsider. Yet,
                    another part—one that leans towards self-preservation—knows better than to dismiss the unease
                    outright.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe I need something concrete, a sign that I’m truly in the crosshairs. A Memento Mori delivered
                    to my doorstep, a Sicilian calling card that screams: <em>You should have listened.</em>

                <h2>Part Fifteen - The Man Beneath the Façade</h2>
                <h5>Friday, 7th February <strong>22:11 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Silvio is NUTS. Like, genuinely, certifiably nuts. I had my suspicions early on, little clues
                    dropped in past conversations, but it’s taken me a while to fully piece together just how deep this
                    madness runs. He’s like Dominic, but with a more unhinged collection of conspiracy theories rattling
                    around in his brain.
                    <br><br>
                    Before COVID, he was a music teacher. That is, until he refused to get the vaccine, putting both
                    students and staff at risk. Not content with just being a personal health hazard, he took it upon
                    himself to start proselytising, urging others to resist the jab as well. Naturally, he got sacked.
                    Rather than accept that actions have consequences, he doubled down, convinced that he was the last
                    bastion of truth in a world brainwashed by “Big Pharma” and government control.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, his response was to open his home to complete strangers, all to prove that the world
                    isn’t a big and scary place. I, for one, completely disagree. The world <em>is</em> a big and scary
                    place, and people like Silvio are a prime example of why. I’m not saying don’t explore; I’m saying
                    remain vigilant and assess potential risks. But, of course, arguing with him would be like reasoning
                    with a lunatic, so I nod along and let him ramble.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there’s his newfound adoration for Communism, which, hilariously, seems to have stemmed from a
                    single Workaway volunteer from Poland. This guy lived under Communist rule and, apparently, now
                    makes less money in a democratic society than he did under an authoritarian regime. Instead of
                    recognising that as anecdotal at best, Silvio has taken this as indisputable proof that communism is
                    the superior way of life. Never mind the historical evidence, the oppression, or the fact that
                    people literally risked their lives escaping it—no, one broke Polish bloke is all the confirmation
                    Silvio needs.
                    <br><br>
                    And then we get to the real kicker: his entire living situation is dodgy as hell. He built this
                    house from the ground up not out of some noble, off-the-grid, self-sufficient dream, but because he
                    was banned from owning property after running an illegal hostel at his previous residence. Again,
                    this isn’t speculation—this is coming directly from him, said with the casual air of someone
                    discussing the weather. He wasn’t confessing, he was bragging.
                    <br><br>
                    But the cherry on top? The church. The derelict church he’s so lovingly restoring isn’t just some
                    quaint pet project or an attempt to give back to the community. No, no, no. He’s renovating it
                    because his son is gay, and he genuinely believes this will somehow “bring him back to the light.” I
                    mean, is it just a church, or is Silvio planning something more grandiose, some twisted little
                    conversion therapy cult under the guise of religious salvation? At this point, I wouldn’t put
                    anything past him.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s actually mental. The more I learn, the more I’m grateful I’m only here for the week instead of
                    a month.

                <h2>Part Fourteen - Palmero = Done ✅</h2>
                <h5>Friday, 7th February <strong>19:02 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Silvio and I decided to take another day off since the weather was perfect. After he prepared me yet
                    another sublime sandwich, I set off for Palermo for the fifth day in a row. But today was
                    different—I walked the entire way. Two and a half hours, passing every station along the train line.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I reached the city centre, I didn’t stop there. I continued south, hugging the coastline,
                    hoping to stumble upon some natural beauty—golden sands, crystal-clear waters, something to redeem
                    Palermo’s rugged exterior. But as I walked further, it became clear that if I kept going in search
                    of paradise, I might as well circumnavigate the entire island. Eventually, I turned back, accepting
                    that Palermo is not quite the grand holiday destination I had imagined. I spent the rest of the
                    afternoon reading Orson Welles’ biography in the park.
                    <br><br>
                    After five days of exploring and covering nearly nine miles a day, I feel I know this city like the
                    back of my hand. Each quarter has its own distinct character. The northeast is picturesque,
                    tourist-friendly, and home to the harbour. The northwest blends verdant parks and grand cathedrals
                    with creeping signs of poverty. The southeast is a grittier stretch—mainly an exit road flanked by a
                    bleak, debris-strewn coastline. The southwest, meanwhile, could easily be mistaken for a slum in the
                    Middle East.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I’ve seen it all.

                <h2>Part Thirteen - Screams, Scams and Skinny Jeans</h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>23:15 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    My first real-world experience with the perfidy of the Sicilians happened tonight. I’d heard the
                    stories about the Mafia and witnessed firsthand the poor conditions they impose on the capital, but
                    a part of me still found it hard to believe the veracity of the tales I’d been told.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me start from the beginning. After a very filling tea consisting of - you guessed it, dough,
                    potatoes and ham in a new combination - Sally and I drove to pub around fifteen minutes away from
                    Silvio’s place to watch the football. He’s still slightly depressed after his beloved Arsenal were
                    humiliated last night. He wanted to see Spurs receive the same treatment but that didn’t come to
                    fruition.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned, he is Sri Lankan but has lived here in Sicily for over a decade working as a handyman.
                    He came over on a cricket scholarship and never left, very much suiting the congruous criminality of
                    Tomasso Natale.
                    <br><br>
                    The pub wasn’t in Palermo but in a place called Vespi. It’s authentically Sicilian. Tourists don’t
                    come this far out of the city - <em>for safety reasons.</em> Everyone’s drinking scotch, smoking
                    cigars. I can’t even see the ceiling because of the thick layer of smoke. We were at the bar
                    enjoying the game, staying out of trouble, until half time at least.
                    <br><br>
                    Then we hear a scream from outside. The only reason I mention it is because of the slightly obscure
                    reaction of everyone in the bar. The reaction was no reaction. It sounded different from a girl just
                    falling over. To me, it sounded more like a shriek of pain but I am just speculating.
                    <br><br>
                    I instinctively get off my bar stool to go look at the commotion, but my arm’s seized by Sally who
                    hasn’t moved. I’m trying to remember but I don’t think anyone was too perturbed by the scream. It
                    was definitely loud enough that everyone could hear. I get back on my stool and ask Sally what’s
                    going on. He’s swirling his scotch around the glass and seems to be lost in a reverie.
                    <br><br>
                    The game finishes and Sally’s chatting to friends at the bar. This is one of the only sports bars
                    outside of Palermo that’s not Mafia controlled - <em>apparently</em> – which is why we’re here. I’m
                    still not entirely sure what that actually means. Are Mafia bars like fronts for laundering money?
                    Are they storing stolen goods? Or just skimming a cut of the profits under the guise of “protection”
                    fees? Of course, all my conclusions are based on <em>A Bronx Tale, Goodfellas, </em>and <em>Donnie
                    Brasco</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m waiting for Sally outside for a few minutes. It’s a convivial atmosphere. It’s a young crowd. My
                    sort of age. Out of nowhere, an Italian bird comes up to me and starts a conversation. I don’t speak
                    Italian, and she doesn’t speak English, <em>though I do speak a little Spanish. Va va vroom.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    With me being a cheeky-chappie, and my “everyone loves an Englishman” attitude, we’re fumbling
                    through this conversation. Her attempts to bridge the language barrier with her gestures and eager
                    smiles are more endearing than effective, but we’re getting somewhere.
                    <br><br>
                    She’s clearly growing impatient, though. With a flirtatious twirl of her hand, she leans in closer.
                    Before I even have time to register what’s happening, she swings both arms around me and is kissing
                    me. At first, I’m caught off guard, thinking this is just the Italian way—passionate, spontaneous, a
                    trademark of Sicilian culture. It’s all part of the dance, right? The grand romantic gesture, the
                    universal language of love that everyone talks about when describing the Italian spirit.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as I’m patting my ego on the back - her hands move lower. I feel a sudden, unexpected tug at
                    the pocket of my jeans. The subtle motion is so fluid, it could have been mistaken for just another
                    affectionate touch—if I hadn’t felt the unmistakable shift in weight as she tried to lift my phone
                    from my pocket.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>I’m being robbed.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    It was an odd feeling. For a second, I’m frozen. My brain is registering what’s happening, but my
                    body lags behind, unsure. As soon as I felt significant weight shift, I think instinct kicked in.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank God for my skinny jeans. I’ve never been so grateful for tight pockets in my life. With a
                    quick movement, I catch my phone, her supple fingers let go and I’m just looking her directly in the
                    eyes.
                    <br><br>
                    This creeped me out. I’ve never seen anyone’s eyes change so vehemently before. Especially someone
                    with such beautiful baby blues… She went from <em>Holly Golightly</em> to <em>Baby Jane</em> real
                    fast. And we all know how terrified I am of the latter.
                    <br><br>
                    Before anything is said, Sally’s once again grabbing me by the arm leading me toward the car. Now I
                    get it. The romance, the flirting? All part of the game. It’s not my charm she’s interested in—just
                    what’s in my trousers. My phone, I mean. My phone.
                    <br><br>
                    I was experiencing a bit of a head rush as we were driving off. I semi-knew what happened but I was
                    still fuzzy. In the car, Sally’s letting me in on the street scams. <em>“They work in teams,”</em>
                    he said, <em>“and if they know you’ve got expensive gear, they’ll target you again.”</em> Well,
                    great to know, and here I thought she was just entranced by my English charm. I’ll have to remember
                    this scam for when the Parisian lucky lucky men come my way.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m still confused about the scream though. He didn’t answer that question, but I doubt it’s as
                    sinister as what we’re all thinking. Sicily may not be as progressive as I had thought but it’s not
                    ran by gangsters and the Mafia in the way that the movies will have us believe. Or am I still being
                    incredibly naïve?

                <h2>Part Twelve - Palermo at My Own Pace</h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>18:50 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    My first day off, and after my little tribulation last night, I <em>needed</em> it. The sun was out,
                    the tasks weren’t urgent, and Silvio let me have the full day to myself—on the condition that I’d
                    work one day over the weekend. No complaints from me, since the weather’s set to turn miserable by
                    Saturday night anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    So, back to Palermo. I tried to catch a walking tour at 11 AM, only to find they don’t exist. Just
                    the 10 AM ones, which was annoying. But since I’ve already combed through this city—top to bottom,
                    east to west, seeing both the picturesque and the profane, the sublime among the malign—today was a
                    much more relaxed affair. Stuck to the high street, indulged in a little window shopping, sat down
                    in every park I passed, and gave my feet the break they desperately deserved.
                    <br><br>
                    For lunch, Silvio had made me a sandwich. Not very Italian I know, but regardless, it was one of the
                    most delicious sandwiches I’ve ever had in my life. It puts my turkey and cheese ensemble to shame.
                    It was the size of a small pancake, filled with fried chicken, lettuce, mozzarella, mayonnaise,
                    zucchini, aubergine, a rare herb found only in the Himalayas, the blood of a mountain goat, the
                    vestiges of the grain forged in the heart of Mount Vesuvius. You get the picture.
                    <br><br>
                    After finishing one fiction yesterday, I started the Orson Welles biography right in front of the
                    Norman Palace. From the first few chapters, he sounds like a relative of Jay Gatsby, interacting
                    with artists, artisans, poets, impresarios, screenwriters, authors, and even Moroccan royalty, all
                    before the youthful crescent of 20! He is unequivocally a gifted child, processing the elocution of
                    a actor much older, becoming a Shakespeare afficionado at twelve, writing his first screenplay at
                    sixteen, Broadway at seventeen. You read about people like this and it’s almost they are destined
                    for greatness.
                    <br><br>
                    One little blunder this afternoon—the public toilets. First off, they’re gender-neutral. How modern.
                    A neat row of cubicles, surprisingly clean, none of the nightmarish filth you brace yourself for
                    when thinking of public loos. My mistake? I thought they were free.
                    <br><br>
                    I go to unlock the door. It doesn’t budge. No problem, probably just jammed. I give it a nudge.
                    Nothing. So, naturally, I resort to shouldering it a few times. It moves slightly, but not enough.
                    One final push—I put my foot through it. Snap. Lock broken. <em>Bit stiff, that,</em> I thought. Of
                    course, it wasn’t stuck. It was locked. Because, as I discovered moments later, Palermo operates on
                    a <em>pay-to-pee</em> system.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Bloody Mafia, taxing us for everything…</em>
                    <br><br>
                    I clock my faux pas as I leave and finally spot the euro signs on the door. Good thing there aren’t
                    cameras in there, or I might be expecting a visit from <em>Tommy-Two-Fingers &
                    Jimmy-the-snitch.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Caught the train back to Cardillo just as the first droplets are starting to fall. If I board five
                    minutes before departure, I can usually circumvent the ticket inspectors. The fare’s only €2, but
                    for all I know, the trains are Mafia-run too. And honestly, I don’t need to add <em>another</em>
                    moral failing to my growing list of peccadillos.

                <h2>Part Eleven - Hallucinogens in the Pasta? </h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>08:53 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I woke up in the middle of the night completely disoriented. No idea if I had a momentary sleepwalk
                    or I rolled the wrong way out of bed, but when I finally came to, I was in the middle of my room,
                    wrapped in my duvet, cowering in a heap on the cold stone floor.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, my room doesn’t have any windows. No charging lights. No alarm clock glow. Just thick,
                    suffocating darkness. I tried fumbling for something—anything—to ground myself, but it was
                    pointless. Sat there waiting for my eyes to adjust, but as I’d already discovered on my first
                    morning here, there needs to be a light source for that to happen. No light source, no vision. Which
                    is why, at 10:30 AM, this room is still black as the void.
                    <br><br>
                    So I stand up trying to get my balance but the stone floor is freezing my feet. Taking my
                    queen-sized duvet, I’m trying to shuffle to something I can latch onto. I don’t want to be dramatic
                    here, but I do remember my sleep depraved mind thinking <em>what if I’ve gone blind – that’s why I
                    can’t see.</em> I don’t know how long standing, trying to understand what was happening. That’s when
                    I heard a object drop onto the stone slabs.
                    <br><br>
                    I drop to my knees, patting the floor trying to find the object; exactly how Velma looked when she
                    dropped her glasses in <em>Scooby-Doo</em>. I found it, it was my laptop mouse. My saving grace in
                    my time of need. The LED light on the underside, the signal guiding me out of my blind purgatory.
                    Clicking the button so the light flashes, it guided me the two feet or so back to my bed. Now, I
                    know this makes me sound completely and utterly retarded, or a dunce, but believe me, it was the
                    most terrified I’ve been in a while thinking I must have gone blind.
                    <br><br>
                    As you can imagine, it took me a while to get back off to sleep after that little charade.

                <h2>Part Ten - Tea Time </h2>
                <h5>Wednesday, 5th February <strong>21:20 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Another <em>riveting</em> dinner table conversation with Silvio this evening. Somehow, we (or rather
                    he) ended up on the topic of gender and sexuality. Latest revelation: he’s a right-wing libertarian.
                    Oh, and homophobic. Loves the idea of living off the land, free from government interference. Which,
                    in hindsight, makes total sense—he built this entire bungalow himself. Something tells me there
                    wasn’t much in the way of planning permission involved, but that’s hardly my problem. Very strong
                    opinions on same-sex marriage. Found myself nodding obsequiously just to stop myself being kicked
                    out onto the streets.
                    <br><br>
                    The real kicker, though, was his deep dive into what is and isn’t controlled. According to him,
                    every restaurant, every independent supermarket, every souvenir shop in Palermo—<em>all</em> of them
                    answer to someone. Turns out, the reason he’s such a dedicated chef isn’t just a love for cooking.
                    He refuses to give a cent to the local supermarkets because, you guessed it, they’re mob-controlled.
                    Even the tacky little souvenir shops? Yep. I’ve unknowingly contributed to <em>the cause</em>. My €1
                    magnet is now a permanent stain on my conscience.
                    <br><br>
                    Food-wise, tonight was a first—pasta. The trademark of Sicilian gastronomy: Macaroni drowned in
                    cheese with meat, peas, and aubergines. Every single ingredient, on its own? Great. But somehow, the
                    combination was <em>deeply</em> unsettling. It tasted like… sick. Weird huh. Obviously, I kept that
                    little critique to myself. Silvio did, however, comment on my portion sizes—apparently, I eat less
                    than any of his previous fourteen guests.
                    <br><br>
                    The routine is simple: at 2 PM, after work, he makes me something—spaghetti, an omelette, or some
                    variation of dough, ham, and cheese. Then I spend my afternoon in Palermo, and by the time I get
                    back at 8 PM, there’s a massive portion of a traditional meal waiting. It’s always still in the pan,
                    ready to be dished up at will. The problem? I’m still full from whatever he made me earlier. And
                    yet, somehow, I still manage to walk away feeling guilty for not eating more.

                <p>
                    Since my hamstrings were aching and my feet cramping up, I didn’t do my marathon long walk around
                    Palermo today. After the disappointing display yesterday, I wanted to stick to the more touristy
                    parts. Plus, today was the first day of sun we’ve had that haven’t been accompanied with clouds, so
                    I didn’t need to do any fancy camera trickery to make my pictures look brighter than it actually
                    was. I stuck by the harbour and settled down to read my book. Nice and relaxing after my onerous
                    morning. I spoke to some of the locals in shops and got my customary magnet. Oddly, I’ve had more
                    conversations in Spanish in Sicily than Italian. I’ve found communicating with locals is easier in
                    Spanish as the Italian equivalent is a closer resemblance than English.
                    <br><br>
                    A calming day despite the hectic start.

                <h2>Part Eight - Scrapes & Bruises</h2>
                <h5>Wednesday, 5th February <strong>14:05 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I got into a car accident this morning. Well, I say accident… Let me clear a few things up. First of
                    all, I wasn’t driving this time which is a nice change in these situations. No one was hurt, just a
                    bit of cosmetic damage to cars that are little more than scrap value anyway. Now, it was hardly
                    surprising that I witnessed one eventually, because the driving I’ve witnessed is mind-boggling.
                    There are road markings, but they are completely disregarded. In the UK, the responsibility is on
                    the driver at the junction to pull out when safe to do so. Slightly different philosophy here;
                    junctions are futile, and cars don’t stop. The onus is on the driver already speeding at 50kph to
                    either slam on the brakes or embrace their fate. Apparently, playing bumper cars isn’t just the
                    accepted status quo—it’s not even considered a transgression.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio proved this firsthand when he pulled straight onto a roundabout and we got clipped. He didn’t
                    even bother exchanging details with the other driver. <em>“These things happen Harry”.</em> Do they?
                    Because where I’m from, this is what insurance fraud is made of. I had a hint of Silvio’s driving
                    going to Montello beach, zigzagging, driving in the middle of the road, going through red lights,
                    etc. I thought Italy was more evolved than this.
                    <br><br>
                    The second half of my workday took a nostalgic turn—right back to my ten-year-old self. Climbing
                    trees and falling out of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I was picking oranges, and since the best ones were at the top, I did what any self-respecting
                    monkey would do: scaled the tree. Agile. Efficient. Until my hamstrings decided otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    After days of walking five miles in flat, unsupportive shoes, my feet chose this exact moment to
                    cramp up. Yelping, I took the express route down—flat on my back. The only witness to my
                    humiliation? Chico, the ever-loyal dog, who bolted over and covered me in concerned, slobbery
                    reassurance.
                    <br><br>
                    At least someone cared.

                <h2>Part Seven - The Real Picture</h2>
                <h5>Tuesday, 4th February <strong>19:05 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I set my alarm this morning, so I didn’t take the same liberties as yesterday. Though this wasn’t
                    needed because my wall borders the main road, and the council started digging it up to fix the
                    sewage line to the property at seven. Still, I didn’t surface until well after nine.
                    <br><br>
                    I was in the shower when I heard the side door squeak and Silvio shout something through to me. Over
                    the noise of the water, I only caught fragments: <em>“Harry, don’t use … … it’s connected to the
                    sewer.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Have I just washed my hair in sewage water? I’d rather not think about it. I used shampoo, so I’m
                    banking on that being an effective barrier against whatever bacteria was swirling around in there.
                    That’s how shampoo works, right?
                    <br><br>
                    The morning’s work was different from yesterday. We were in the church around the side of the
                    property, restoring furniture and parts of the altar. The construction is still in its early stages,
                    so today was mostly sanding. I met Sally, a Sri Lankan handyman hired to maintain the property. And
                    in case there’s any confusion—Sally is a bloke, with a heart of gold and an <em>adorable</em> dog
                    called Chico. He gave me some solid recommendations on places to check out in Palermo and, more
                    importantly, places to avoid.
                    <br><br>
                    So, naturally, in true adventurer fashion, I ignored his advice entirely.
                    <br><br>
                    When I got to Palermo, I headed west—away from the tourist hubs, away from the postcard version of
                    the city. Big mistake. Three hours of wandering, and what did I see? Bike thieves swiping two phones
                    in broad daylight, a dead dog rotting by the side of the road, kids who couldn’t have been older
                    than twelve smoking weed, and street vendors casually doing a line of something <em>definitely</em>
                    not legal. This was Sicily without the filter. The kind you don’t find in the brochures.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve never wanted to get back to civilised society so badly. I didn’t dare get my camera out for
                    fear of it getting taxed…
                    <br><br>
                    I returned to Silvio’s place disconsolate. This isn’t what I had in mind when I wanted to spend the
                    week in Sicily. To make up for this failed expedition, Silvio had an authentic spaghetti recipe
                    waiting for me. It wasn’t in a bolognaise but just in a sauce that was delicious. When I asked for
                    it, you would have thought that I had just harvested his Abuela for organs. <em>“No, no, no, Harry.
                    Not something I can do!”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Family recipes in Sicily aren’t just food; they’re legacy. To be enjoyed, never altered, and
                    certainly never shared. Lesson learned.
                    <br><br>
                    Slight digression back to the civilised world of Leicester. As I’m writing this, I’m also in contact
                    with the writers, sorting out the next edition of Demon Magazine. And I’m absolutely howling. Why?
                    Because I’ve just thrown two lads under the bus, pissed off all the women in the group chat with a
                    hilarious (but apparently sexist) gif, and now I’m being threatened with being reported to the
                    student union. (For context, the student union is run by one guy called Dave—quite possibly the most
                    laid-back man alive. The fact that he has full control over every society at the university while
                    maintaining such extreme levels of nonchalance is, frankly, mind-blowing.)
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, let me explain—once I’ve stopped giggling.
                    <br><br>
                    So, these two lads both wanted to do a Champions League roundup for the issue. I chimed in with,
                    <em>“If one of you wants to do an article explaining the new CL format, that would be fucking
                        helpful 🤣.”</em> Jess—our ever-efficient editor—promptly assigned both their names to the
                    spreadsheet, effectively sealing their fate. After a bit of back and forth in the chat, they
                    begrudgingly decided who was writing what. That should’ve been the end of it.
                    <br><br>
                    But, of course, I couldn’t leave it there.
                    <br><br>
                    I suggested giving them <em>both</em> a double-page spread, because, well, I’m a nob. Jess, again,
                    ratified it without hesitation. <em>Hahaha.</em> I threw in a final <em>“Well done, lads—can’t wait
                    to read them!”</em> just to show how gracious I was.
                    <br><br>
                    Then Molly, our design editor, piped up. <em>“I don’t even know what CL is.”</em> Instead of simply
                    explaining it, I dropped a Ricky Gervais meme (as shown below). The lads responded with laughing
                    emojis. The women in the chat? A <em>deluge</em> of outrage. I’m <em>bad</em> laughing…
                    <br><br>
                    Any who, that’s enough interlocution for this evening.

                <h2>Part Six - A Day in the Life</h2>
                <h5>Monday, 3rd February <strong>22:19 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Woke up at 10:40 this morning—just to set a precedent. Two texts from Silvio instructing me to meet
                    him at the church. Within this small cluster of houses, there’s a church, a few storage buildings,
                    and other assorted structures that seem to serve no clear purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    Monday’s tasks were as uninspiring as expected—hauling wood outside the bungalow, sweeping up,
                    tidying the walkways. Menial but necessary. Silvio’s little house, a product of his own hands (and a
                    few Workaway volunteers over the years), stands as a testament to determination—if not necessarily
                    to craftsmanship. For that reason, I can excuse the loose wiring and the temperamental water flow.
                    Consider them <em>charming quirks</em> rather than flaws.
                    <br><br>
                    With the jobs done by half one, I headed into Palermo. It felt like Stockholm again—Kindle in hand,
                    zoning out on the metro, heading straight for the centre. The closer we got, the more the scenery
                    improved. Gone were the rundown streets and battered cars. Instead, grand old buildings, buzzing
                    cafés, and streets that actually looked like they belonged in Italy. <em>This</em> was the Palermo I
                    had imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked from the station to the docks, covering the harbour and following the shoreline. No real
                    plan—just wandering. The sea breeze, the smell of salt and espresso mixing in the air, the city
                    shifting from chaotic to calm the further I went. The place has layers. Tourists snapping pics
                    outside cathedrals, locals arguing on street corners, old men in sharp suits sipping espresso like
                    they own the place. Maybe they do.
                    <br><br>
                    I kept walking until the sun dipped and the streetlights flickered on. That was my cue to turn back,
                    retracing my steps to the station, ready to catch the train home. A solid first look at Palermo.
                    Tomorrow, I go deeper.
                    <br><br>
                    25,000 steps and seven miles later, I’m back at Silvio’s with a feast of sausages, roast potatoes
                    and onions waiting for me. Thank goodness it wasn’t more dough. I needed to discreetly bin the
                    leftover pizza that he made me for lunch because the dough’s texture was similar to glue.
                    <br><br>
                    Over dinner, Silvio went further into his philosophy of parenting, love of food, staying connected
                    with our roots. Then he moved onto some contentious issues: Palestine-Gaza, Trump, thoughts on
                    homosexuality. Some opinions differed to my own, though I wasn’t going to disagree. <em>Don’t bite
                    the hand that feeds you.</em>

                <h2>Part Five - First Impressions</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>21:45 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Everything I eat this week is going to be some combination of dough and mozzarella. My cholesterol
                    is about to skyrocket. The two meals I’ve had today were pleasant enough, but overwhelmingly
                    dough-based, and I’m already craving some variety. Slim chance. My portion sizes are already
                    small—famously so—but I don’t want to seem impertinent by leaving food unfinished. Hence why I’m
                    sitting here writing, trying to distract myself from the nausea, instead of catching up on
                    much-needed sleep. I was up at 4 a.m. to catch the bus from Mile End—it’s a miracle I’m still awake.
                    <br><br>
                    First impressions? Mixed. The house was entirely built by Silvio and a rotating cast of Workaway
                    volunteers, so if a joist collapses in the middle of the night, I won’t be surprised. The area
                    leaves much to be desired, but for just €2 a day, I’ll be escaping to Palermo whenever I can.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio is amicable and always up for conversation. The reason he hosts volunteers, he says, is
                    because his ex-wife has instilled a fear of strangers in their children—taught them to stay away,
                    not to explore, not to trust. Silvio is determined to prove her wrong by inviting strangers into his
                    home. An interesting strategy for winning an argument, especially with someone he openly despises,
                    but hey-ho.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing I’ve quickly picked up on in Tommaso Natale—there’s no middle ground when it comes to
                    cars. You’re either driving a battered Toyota or Citroën, held together by sheer willpower, or
                    you’re gliding around in a pristine, brand-new Alfa Romeo or Mercedes. No in-between. The disparity
                    was even more glaring this afternoon at Montello Beach. There are just some cars that no one dared
                    to touch.

                <h2>Part Four - Roaming the Area</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>17:49 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I set off with my camera to explore the neighbourhood, only to find more of the same desolation I
                    had witnessed on the drive in. Litter blanketed the streets, shattered glass crunched underfoot, and
                    every other window seemed to have surrendered to vandalism. The roads were a free-for-all—cars
                    careening past at reckless speeds, emboldened by the absence of cameras or speed bumps. If I were
                    documenting the decay of civilisation, this would be an excellent place to start. Thankfully, with
                    the train so close, I’ll be escaping to Palermo most days to distance myself from this slum.
                    <br><br>
                    As I meandered through the streets, camera in hand, I encountered four people over the course of
                    half an hour, each of whom responded with irritated gestures and muttered variations of <em>“No
                    fotodora, no fotodora.”</em> I don’t speak Italian, but the message was clear. It wasn’t exactly
                    the warm reception I had envisioned. An hour into my walk, it became apparent that this town was
                    little more than a pit stop—a transit hub on the way to somewhere better. There was no lingering
                    charm, no picturesque beauty to unearth. The coast lies 5km east, and Palermo is just a short train
                    ride away. At least the train is cheap. Even cheaper if I feign ignorance and ride the wave of
                    tourist oblivion.
                    <br><br>
                    Once Silvio’s friends had dispersed, we headed to Montello Beach. A quaint seaside town, it ticks
                    the expected boxes—an improvement on the suburbs, but still falling short of the Sicilian paradise I
                    had imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    According to Silvio, the town’s social divide is glaringly obvious. <em>“There are two groups,”</em>
                    he told me. <em>“Italians and Albanians.”</em> I asked how I was supposed to tell the difference. He
                    smirked. <em>“You’ll know.”</em> I thought he was joking—until I saw it for myself.
                    <br><br>
                    The contrast is stark. The Italians are effortlessly well-groomed, with chiselled jawlines and skin
                    so clear it could be bottled and sold. The Albanians, in contrast, are built like barrels—just as
                    wide as they are tall—uniformly clad in full Slazenger tracksuits. They control the games, the
                    street vendors, the lucky lucky men who peddle trinkets along the beach. Before we split up, Silvio
                    offered one final piece of advice: <em>“Keep a tight grip on your camera.”</em>

                <h2>Part Three - Meeting Silvio</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>12:15 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    The four-hour flight turned out to be just two and a half—a sign of good fortune, surely. I caught
                    the train just as it was departing, and whether it was my tourist status or the fact that I flashed
                    the inspector a screenshot of a valid ticket, I somehow got the journey for free.
                    <br><br>
                    I was meeting Silvio at Tommaso Natale Station, 15 minutes outside Palermo. A small town that,
                    unfortunately, does not live up to the romanticised images of Sicilian charm. No sidewalks,
                    litter-strewn roadsides, battered cars that look like they’ve barely survived their last outing—what
                    kind of slum have I landed in?
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio pulled up in a black Toyota Yaris, as dilapidated as its surroundings. The front bumper
                    dangled precariously, while streaks of red paint hinted at a few too many close encounters. I loaded
                    my case, and just like that, we were off—at a speed that suggested he mistook my arrival for the
                    start of a Formula One sprint. The first thing he said was, "<em>My English is not perfect.</em>"
                    Setting expectations early—exactly what I would do.
                    <br><br>
                    His house is only a short drive from the station. I could have walked, but he insisted on playing
                    the gracious host. A better first impression than Caroline in Güéjar Sierra—after a three-hour bus
                    from Málaga and two more from Granada, she couldn’t even be bothered to pick me up from the foot of
                    the mountain in the sweltering heat.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio offered two warnings before I ventured out exploring:
                    <br><br>
                    1. <em>Watch out for cars when stepping out the front door. The house sits directly on a main road,
                    and buses, in particular, skim dangerously close since there’s no sidewalk.</em>
                    <br>2.<em> Watch out for the mafia.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Excuse me?
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t question him. Maybe I misheard. Maybe his English wasn’t quite translating the way he
                    intended. Either way, I filed that little nugget of information away for later.
                    <br><br>
                    When we arrived, Silvio was already hosting friends—apparently a frequent occurrence, given that his
                    kitchen is equipped like a professional setup. Whether this is because he’s a chef or simply a
                    product of his Italian heritage remains to be seen.
                    <br><br>
                    His house is a small cottage within a gated community, tucked away at the end of a courtyard where
                    chickens and hens roam freely. My room is cozy, nestled at the back of the house, complete with a
                    double bed and squeaky closets. A quick inspection revealed the <em>Complete Works of
                    Shakespeare</em>—in Italian. That’s a conversation I’m looking forward to.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio gave me a tour of the house and the property, but we haven’t yet discussed what exactly I’ll
                    be doing here. Judging by my surroundings, I suspect the work will be simple yet
                    time-consuming—collecting eggs, washing dishes, helping with meals. Speaking of meals, Silvio
                    mentioned he’ll be giving me a menu before each one. I’m probably about to eat the best food of my
                    life, but will I appreciate it with my tragically undeveloped palate? Bolognese, pasta, pizza,
                    lasagna—he assures me he can make them the <em>new way</em> or the <em>classic way</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    But the real question is—can he make it just like <em>mother makes…?</em>

                <h2>Part Two - The Journey's always the best part</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>08:13 GMT</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    That’s a lie. The journey is never the best part when traveling alone. The real magic begins when
                    you’re finally set loose in a new city, armed only with your wits and the burning need to experience
                    everything and everyone in the fleeting time you have.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I’m headed to Palermo—but Palermo is a broad term, the same way London is. I could claim to
                    live in London while renting a flat in Watford. My point? I highly doubt Silvio’s place is nestled
                    in the heart of Sicily’s tourist hub. More likely, he’s tucked away in some suburban sprawl. I’m
                    just hoping he’s not too far from the action—and that the public transport system is at least
                    somewhat intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    So, what are my goals for this week? Learn a little Italian. Explore a new city. Take an obscene
                    amount of photos. And—most importantly—commit to a digital detox. It’s something I’ve been meaning
                    to do for ages, but it’s hardly practical while juggling a Computer Science degree. This week,
                    though, I’m officially off the grid (minus these blog updates, of course). No deadlines to meet, no
                    articles to write, no software to debug. Just pure, uninterrupted freedom.
                    <br><br>
                    So far, everything is running smoothly. And if the woman behind me would kindly stop kneeing my
                    chair, this day might just shape up to be a beautiful one.

                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>05:23 GMT</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Airports: the only socially acceptable place to start drinking at 6 a.m. With just a few minutes
                    until boarding, I figured I’d kick off my Workaway 2.0 journal by answering all your burning
                    questions.
                    <br><br>
                    This time, I’m headed to Palermo, Sicily, for my second Workaway experience. After my first
                    excursion failed to be an overwhelming success, I’m determined to give it another go—this time with
                    more realistic expectations. This trip is the epitome of spontaneity. I only started searching for
                    hosts a week ago, so when I say last minute, I mean <em>last minute</em>. Out of the twelve hosts
                    who
                    responded, only two had availability: Silvio in Sicily and Benoît in Mons. Sicily seemed like the
                    better fit.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, Silvio’s profile was rather vague about the tasks he needed help with, and given the hasty
                    nature of this trip, we haven’t even had a FaceTime call to go over the details. Our correspondence
                    has been daily, though, and his profile boasts a dozen glowing reviews. What could possibly go
                    wrong?
                    <br><br>
                    Apparently, I won’t be the only one staying at his place during my ten-day visit, but as for who
                    this mystery guest is? No idea. I’m fully aware I’m walking into a potentially precarious
                    situation—but at the very least, I’ll have a story to tell... the police.

                    So that's it. The end of my volunteering. Back on home soil; what a journey it’s been. Would I have
                    thought that I could have done this a year ago. Definitely not. I may have my gripes about choosing
                    Stockholm as the destination for my Erasmus year, but I have incontestably became a more sanguine
                    and
                    intrepid person because of it. I am now receptive to new opportunities and have this new mindset of
                    throwing myself into the deep end because even if it does turn out to be a complete disaster, it
                    will be
                    an experience. My incipient temerity for travelling is something which I am proud of myself for
                    doing
                    but with this particular chapter of my life closing, it is time to get back into my studying mindset

                    focus on achieving my first in Computer Science. The past year has been a whirlwind at times and of
                    course there were moments of anxiety and hesitation in some situations but overall I am pleased with
                    the
                    outcome and the places I’ve been. Seeing a show at the Vienna Opera house, visiting Van Gogh
                    paintings
                    in Amsterdam, learning the origins of the Nobel prize ceremony in Stockholm, being hit by cyclists
                    in
                    Copenhagen and being close to contracting frostbite in Oslo. I will continue to travel to see new
                    places
                    and hopefully continue my language journey but for now it’s back to University.

                <h2>Chapter 19 - Another Day, Another Airport</h2>
                <h5 class="date">04/08/2024 12:34 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Three buses it took to get me to Malaga Airport. In order to make the 13:35 flight time, I was at
                    the
                    Guejar Sierra bus stop at 8am this morning. I thanked Caroline and Javi for their hospitality over
                    the
                    past three weeks and made the shallow offer to keep in touch. The buses themselves were not as
                    intuitive
                    as they should have been. I found this out upon arrival into Granada hence the need for an uber on
                    the
                    first day. The bus stops are poorly marked and if I hadn’t seen the A4 printed sheet of paper which
                    had
                    slid down the lamp post it was affixed to I would have missed my bus because I would have been
                    waiting
                    at the wrong place. For those interested, the sign said ‘This bus does not go up the plaza in the
                    month
                    of August.’ What’s the date: 4th August. Thankfully I did walk to the main roundabout where the
                    first
                    bus was waiting. Made it with seconds to spare. This bus was only to take me as far as the outskirts
                    of
                    Granada; I would then be boarding another to take me to the bus station where I would catch my final
                    bus
                    taking me to Malaga. The buses are free in Granada which makes a refreshing change, although the
                    public
                    transport is normally quite reasonable anywhere in Europe. Literally anywhere but the UK.
                    <br><br>
                    Three hours of bus travel later and I’m finally at Malaga Airport for midday. Remembering the queues
                    to
                    get through border control arriving into Spain, I thought I had messed up my timings. Genuinely
                    thinking
                    I would miss my flight, these fears only grew when I saw baggage check-in for RyanAir. The queue
                    stretched past the 45 minute sign and that was the moment my heart sunk. I was definitely going to
                    miss
                    my flight. But then a hint of good fortune passed over me. The staff member was segregating people
                    into
                    lines based on if they had the RyanAir app or not. Being the tech-savvy gen Z which I am, I do
                    everything digitally. I was ushered to the self check in which took a total of five minutes whilst
                    the
                    baby boomers were waiting with the other tech illiterates. Dancing through the self checkout I
                    ploughed
                    forth toward the security gates. Empirically judging from my experiences at various airports over
                    the
                    past year, Malaga is probably the worst organised. Standing in the middle of the foyer, there was no
                    indication of where I should be heading. Watching a maelstrom of people being herded about, looking
                    lost
                    and following the crowd would have been comical if I wasn’t in the centre of all this. Thanks to the
                    self check-in, I now had plenty of time so I could wander through the crowds like a lost puppy until
                    I
                    found the way.
                    <br><br>
                    I sat looking at my gate and I know I’m in the right place. I’m surrounded by my people. “Wei ayes”
                    and
                    “Nee bother pals” are in the common lexicon around me. Geordies have a certain look about them when
                    they
                    are on holiday. Sports shorts and a running shirt is the casual wear because that’s the thinnest
                    clothing they own. A tan line which separates the pale white skin from their burnt red. We put a
                    cloud
                    over the elegance of the Spaniards and mall their idyllic cities by the plane load. Barcelona
                    environs
                    probably have the right philosophy by throwing water bombs and abusing tourists. It would be a
                    perfectly
                    sound thing to do because if I wasn’t geordie adjacent, I would feel the exact same. Their argument
                    crumbles when you realised that 14% of the Barcelona GDP comes from tourists. That figure likely
                    skyrockets towards the half century mark in Malaga from the Geordies alone. TV shows like Love
                    Island
                    and other cringy reality shows are likely the reason for the mass emigration to southern Spain
                    during
                    the summer.
                    <br><br>
                    My flight is boarding now but I won’t be moving for at least another twenty minutes. I only have a
                    small
                    carry-on bag so I am not wrestling somebody for locker space. I am hoping to sleep through most of
                    the
                    flight because I only had a few hours sleep last night. Hopefully this flight is more tolerable than
                    the
                    arriving flight. That means no little shits called Jimmy running rampant. I’ll keep you informed.

                <h2>Chapter 18 - Final Thoughts</h2>
                <h5 class="date">03/08/2024 19:24 CET </h5>
                <p>
                    So today is my last day in the Guejar Sierra and I thought this would be the potent opportunity to
                    reflect on my motivations, what I’ve learnt and other signs of growth and development. After a rocky
                    start and adjusting to the change of scenery, it is important to recognise that just because
                    something
                    is difficult to begin with, doesn’t mean it will remain hard to adapt. Resilience is something which
                    everyone is good at and yet so oblivious to. Moving to a new environment brings the same feelings of
                    trepidation and apprehension irrespective of whether you're moving house or emigrating to a foreign
                    country. The differences in routine can be a difficult storm to weather but with time, a new routine
                    will be established. In my time in the Guejar Sierra, the first week or so proved to be more
                    difficult
                    than I had anticipated. I have never had the experience of living with people, especially strangers.
                    Understandably, it took time to adjust to each other and learn the house rules.
                    <br><br>
                    Given that the raison d'etre for my being there was to be another pair of hands, I found it
                    incumbent to
                    help wherever I could. There were certain jobs which I couldn’t do based on the tools which were
                    supplied but after explaining the issues, we were able to come to an agreement which was amenable
                    for
                    both of us.
                    <br><br>
                    I have no negatives to express in regards to the village. It’s a paragon of Spanish culture, being
                    home
                    to almost 3000 people. Many of which were amicable and patient when I was struggling through a
                    Spanish
                    sentence, however similar to all things. There were individuals who couldn’t understand any English
                    at
                    all and therefore didn’t welcome my presence in their village. Despite its paltry size, it still
                    accommodates everyone’s needs with a number of Butchers, grocery stores, fish markets and other
                    essential establishments like pharmacies and banks. (Though the bank is rather superfluous since
                    every
                    shop only accepts cash payments.)
                    <br><br>
                    Niquito and I explored every thoroughfare and he took me up mountains and hiking trails which were
                    great
                    picture opportunities. Averaging over 6 miles, I covered almost every corner of the village. We saw
                    the
                    same people on our travels allowing me to practise my Spanish small talk. In terms of what I’ve
                    learnt,
                    it is impossible to distinguish a metric which can comprehensively measure everything which I have
                    picked up but from my point of view, I think this has been a valuable experience in terms of
                    adaptability and in taking great strides in achieving my overall goal of being fluent in Spanish.
                    The
                    phrases and speech patterns which I heard from the locals were the type of things which I expected
                    to
                    learn as it is hard to determine colloquial language from learning via Duolingo.
                    <br><br>
                    The question which I will assuredly be asked when divulging my tales of Spain is ‘Would I like to
                    return.’ Short answer: Yes. Long answer: In a few years, possibly. I want to continue my Spanish
                    journey
                    but Spain is a big country with a wide profusion of people and cultures. As picturesque as the
                    village
                    was, it was tedious to get to from the closest airport, the public transport was reasonable but, at
                    times, complicated to discern the right bus, and the village is an hour away from the closest city.
                    I
                    unequivocally enjoyed my time in the Sierra Nevada but I am a city boy at heart and will hope to
                    explore
                    the diversity of Madrid or Barcelona in my next trip to Espana.

                <p>
                    After being here for over two weeks, I feel like I have finally adjusted to the status quo in the
                    desert. The trepidation I had in the first few days was slowly assuaged and in the end, I just
                    needed a
                    little time to acclimatise to the culture shock of a traditional Spanish village. However, now I
                    have
                    found a daily routine with Caroline and Javi, I could stay for another month and it wouldn’t make a
                    difference to me. However, my flight leaves in two days so I need to break it to Caroline and
                    hopefully
                    they don’t get too disheartened about my premature departure. Though I think I am being quixotic
                    when I
                    say this. Personally, I think it will be Niquito who misses me the most since it is I who is walking
                    and
                    feeding him most days. Goodbye my little shagger.

                <h2>Chapter 16 - The Digital Nomad Life</h2>
                <h5 class="date">01/08/2024 18:05 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    I've been left alone with my thoughts for the past two days while Caroline has been taking Javi to
                    appointments in Granada. Besides my daily chores like walking the dog and keeping the apartment
                    tidy,
                    I've been feeling somewhat unfulfilled. Living in a foreign country isn't the insurmountable
                    challenge
                    many perceive it to be. Based on my own experiences—spending a year in Stockholm and the past few
                    weeks
                    in Spain—I've realised that once the initial culture shock fades and a routine is established, life
                    in
                    Guejar Sierra shares many similarities with life in the UK. <br><br>
                    I go out and practise my Spanish, cook meals using recipes from home, walk the dog, and experiment
                    with
                    my camera to test different apertures. This village is as idyllic as they come, but my mind feels
                    unstimulated. For that reason, I've found fresh relief in coding again. It activates my brain and
                    still
                    falls under the broad umbrella of revision in preparation for my final year of university. It's a
                    win-win. <br><br>
                    Instagram may not be a reliable metric for reality, but I often see influencers "working" with their
                    laptops on beaches or in glamping tents. I'm unsure of the correlation between productivity and
                    environment, but for me, it makes no difference. If anything, I get irritated by the heat and become
                    irascible. I've been working in the dark for most of the past two days because as soon as we open
                    the
                    shutters, the room turns into a sauna. <br><br>
                    Travelling has become a new passion of mine, and it indeed broadens the mind. I've become more
                    receptive
                    to new cultures and more sociable with people from different backgrounds. However, I might need to
                    keep
                    these visits as temporary holidays because I'm doubtful that I could work effectively anywhere other
                    than a proper working environment. (How mundane is that!) This affirms my thoughts after hearing
                    Benjamin talk about his life of travelling. Certain people don't need a home or an anchor to remind
                    them
                    of their creature comforts. If digital nomads can work anywhere, it follows that they can live
                    anywhere.
                    Unfortunately for me, when I'm on holiday, I'm entirely in that mindset.

                    Another beautiful day in Guejar Sierra. The sun is shining, the birds are singing. All is well in
                    the
                    Sierra Nevada. After my brief encounter on Saturday night, I have never regretted not taking my
                    phone
                    with me so much. No number, no pictures, nothing but intangible memories of my night dancing in the
                    square. It is premature to use the word solemate, but it is a reasonable thought vis-a-vis our night
                    together. I’m hoping I will serendipitously encounter Maria again when I am out walking with Niquito
                    but
                    I don’t believe the universe is so kind. The locals have started recognising me and I am managing
                    short
                    conversations. I am assimilating enough Spanish to get me through day-to-day conversations, such as
                    grocery shopping or making small talk about the weather or the village. Esta bien! I have acclimated
                    to
                    the heat too, which is a blessing. When I first arrived, I thought it was unbearable, however now, I
                    can
                    live with it. It’s Niquito who stops me from walking him between his siesta hours of three and six.
                    This
                    gives me the opportunity to go on a hike with my camera or down by the river. Village life is
                    enjoyable
                    when it’s tranquil and peaceful. In my spare time I have been reading and writing, hoping to improve
                    my
                    craft. I only have five days left here so I want to make every moment memorable.

                <h5>28/07/2024 20:14 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Today has been a glimpse into the domestic family life which happens from time to time. It just so
                    happened to coincide with the first thunderstorm since being here. Since last night was a late one,
                    Caroline and myself have been resting for most of the day. I don’t sleep much anyway so I was
                    walking
                    Niquito at around 11 this morning. Caroline dropped Benjamin off at Granada bus station at the same
                    time. He is travelling to Sevilla to go on a silent retreat. Very holistic indeed. I’ve been
                    watching
                    the F1 whilst Caroline caught up on her sleep, or tried to through Javi’s persistent screaming.
                    Enough
                    is enough, Caroline screamed back sending Javi into a toddler tantrum. Do teenagers still cry and
                    winge
                    like this? Did I? Having confiscated his Xbox, Javi was whimpering in his room but at least Caroline
                    could get to sleep. I don’t know if it was a coincidence that all this happened just when the
                    thunderstorm started. What seemed to be an aberration in the weather sent waves throughout the
                    village,
                    upsetting the equilibrium of everyone in the vicinity. I was keeping absent from this family affair
                    but
                    my ears kept pricking up because when Caroline shouts Javi, it sounds like Harry. A chill shoots up
                    my
                    spine when I think I’m next on her hit list. I think we need to get some fresh air to cool off.

                <h2>Chapter 13 - Take my Hand and We'll Dance All Night</h2>
                <h5>28/07/2024 13:06 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    I have never had a night like last night. Ever. I wanted to experience the bustling nightlife in the
                    Sierra Nevada, so I followed Caroline and Benjamin to the village for the Saturday night
                    festivities.
                    For a village that is normally quiet, it comes alive on the weekends. The little village square
                    fills
                    with families, pets, and couples, both young and old. Everyone comes together. Everyone knows
                    everyone.
                    The bar tables are set out like the Last Supper, with everyone shuffling together and socializing
                    with
                    whomever they come into contact with. Caroline doesn't drink, which was good for me because I had a
                    coherent translator when I needed her. Most people indulged me as I struggled through with broken
                    Spanish, but most understood English anyway. My English accent perplexed some of them, but they were
                    intrigued by English culture and quizzed me on regal history. I never thought I would be questioned
                    on
                    the House of Hanover in a little village in the south of Spain.
                    <br><br>
                    As the breeze cooled the air, the band started playing. There seemed to be an unspoken agreement
                    (which
                    Caroline later explained to me) that all the children and pets needed to leave at midnight. It was
                    an
                    unofficial curfew in place to allow the parents time away from their kids. With all the children and
                    teenagers vacating the square, I could get a better grasp of the age demographic of the village.
                    Normally, when I go out on my walks with Niquito, I see the same people: usually old folks, sitting
                    in
                    the same spot in the sun from dawn till dusk. This evening, I saw that after midnight is when my
                    generation comes out to play. And that’s when my life turned into a movie.
                    <br><br>
                    I was sitting on the periphery of the square with Benjamin, watching everyone dancing and smiling.
                    That’s when I heard the most beautiful sound I had ever heard. Maria... All the beautiful sounds of
                    the
                    world in a single word... Maria! She sat down next to me with her long locks and big blue eyes and
                    asked
                    me to dance. Taking my hand, she pulled me into the square with little resistance. The bachata is
                    not a
                    dance I was familiar with, as I whispered in her ear. But Maria, cunning and persistent Maria,
                    taught
                    me. Dancing is just maintaining rhythm, and thankfully, I have that in abundance. I was a quick
                    study.
                    We held each other close and moved as one. We sang and danced as the music played. This is living.
                    Immersing oneself into the heart of Spanish culture. The thrill of learning new things and meeting
                    new
                    people. I don’t know if it was the alcohol in the air, the sound of the Latin music, or the buzz of
                    dancing in a village square in the early hours of the morning, but it was intoxicating. We danced
                    and
                    danced until the music stopped. As the bachata is such an intimate affair, we ended our partnership
                    with
                    a kiss. Ironic how we were in Spain, but the kiss was <i>French</i>. I sauntered over to Benjamin,
                    who
                    was
                    grinning as much as I was. He put his arm around me, "Oh, what I would do to be able to dance like
                    that
                    again—you lucky bastard." We ambled back to the apartment with a spring in our step, watching the
                    light
                    pass over the village, marking the start of a new day.

                <h2>Chapter 12 - We Have a Visitor</h2>
                <h5>27/07/2024 14:44 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    I was told this morning that a friend of Caroline’s was staying for one night. Since I’m occupying
                    the
                    spare bedroom, he has to make do with the couch. I’m currently unsure of the dynamic of this
                    relationship. Friend? Boyfriend? When I arrived back from a particularly stressful walk with
                    Niquito,
                    Benjamin was unpacking his backpack in the lounge. He must be mid to late thirties based on the
                    receding
                    hairline and the style of branded polo shirts he wore. He was only passing through for one night so
                    it
                    would only be a brief encounter. Caroline cooked this delicious meat stew for us which didn’t
                    stretch
                    four ways. Since I’m the guest, I thought it was prudent to sacrifice my portion to give to Javi.
                    Was he
                    thankful? Succinctly, no. Benjamin has a plethora of stories from his days backpacking and
                    couchsurfing.
                    He is a native Iranian but moved to Spain five years ago after the middle east became increasingly
                    hostile again.
                    <br><br>
                    He is the paragon of an old man with a young soul. He’s never settled down, got a
                    mortgage and a car. The digital nomad life suits him. He has this great philosophy that life should
                    be
                    based around experiences instead of conforming to social norms. “Work shouldn't be the centre of our
                    lives, making us happy with just a few holidays a year. We should be travelling and working remotely
                    to
                    enrich ourselves every day, not just for a couple of weeks each year.” I think he’s preaching a
                    valuable
                    lesson but ignoring a number of human behavioural traits. Most people need structure, routine and
                    comfort. All of which can be found by settling down in one place. Holidays are there to break the
                    monotony. As much as I like travelling and seeing new places, I think I need the structure otherwise
                    I
                    can’t differentiate my work/life balance. He certainly made me think what my life would be like as a
                    digital nomad though. Learning languages from natives, moving city to city, seeing the world. It’s
                    incredibly enticing - or beguiling.

                <p>
                    So up until this point, I was under the impression that Javi did not speak English. Well this is
                    technically correct but today I heard him speak English to his friends online so there must have
                    been a
                    time when he was fluent and he only remembers memorable words. With Caroline out doing a river hike,
                    I
                    am left keeping an eye on Javi but I leave him to his own devices playing Xbox. Evidently, he isn’t
                    very
                    good and I often hear him smashing and screaming in his room. The few English words I hear him say
                    are
                    the only English words which even I’m not allowed to say. Yes, I’m talking about the racial
                    epithets.
                    Most sentences are in Spanish but when he dies or concedes, (I don’t know which game he’s playing),
                    an
                    English polemic is unleashed. He is thirteen so I don’t know if he thinks it means something
                    different
                    or he just thinks that it is fine because he isn’t being racist in his own language. The latter, I
                    think, is worse but I don’t know. I was as addicted as he is to the Xbox but I don’t remember
                    screaming
                    and throwing tantrums when I lose. I certainly didn’t resort to breaking my controllers or punching
                    holes in the wall. I am leaving him to it because I can’t have the conversation alone with him
                    admonishing him for using inappropriate language. Also, there is a high possibility that he will
                    resort
                    to playing dumb and pretend he doesn’t understand me like what he has done in the past. Caroline is
                    still confident that Javi can speak fluent English but I think this is an outdated belief. I don’t
                    doubt
                    that he has been fluent once upon a time in order to remember the words he can but he has all but
                    forgotten since he has been living in Spain for the best part of a decade.

                <h2>Chapter 10 - A Day In the Life in Guejar Sierra</h2>
                <h5 class="date">26/07/2024 20:15 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Most mornings, I am left to get up in my own time. That is after I am woken by either the cats
                    purring
                    for food on my balcony or Caroline and Javi banging around to leave the apartment by 8:15. I am
                    still
                    operating on English time, therefore I have breakfast when I get up. I am only here for another week
                    and
                    a half so I’m not going to drastically change my normal habits just to immerse myself fully into
                    Spanish
                    culture. Normally, I find myself having to shut Niquito in one of the bedrooms whilst I have
                    breakfast
                    because he tries to jump on the table or hump my leg. Either way, it’s very distracting. Then he
                    starts
                    to bark if I don’t take him out within half an hour. After Caroline and Javi leave, Niquito just
                    sits
                    outside my door waiting to go. The weather is very humid irrespective of the time we go out but I
                    find
                    it more bearable in the mornings than the evenings which is why I find it confounding that the
                    Spanish
                    inclination is to wake up late and go to bed late. When I am walking Niquito in the evening, the
                    temperatures don’t precipitously drop as everyone ostensibly thinks. Clearly, I just don’t have the
                    Spanish motivation to keep telling myself this.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve realised that we seem to pass the same people on the streets. Many are geniatric folk and don’t
                    move at all. They sit on their deck chairs when we pass them in the morning and ten hours later on
                    our
                    evening walk, they are still there. I exchange an effervescent ‘Hola’ in my best Spanish accent and
                    hastily continue walking so they don’t have time to retort with a Spanish sentence which I won’t
                    understand.
                    <br><br>
                    Because I am here under the guise of working in exchange for free rent and food, I do my best to
                    accomplish my tasks. I keep the apartment tidy and have lunch ready for when Caroline and Javi
                    return
                    mid-afternoon. My day-to-day tasks include: replenishing the food for the pets, dog walking,
                    washing/drying up and occasionally hanging washing out. I must remember to refill the cat food last
                    thing on an evening because they seem to be nocturnal and otherwise they will keep me away with
                    their
                    purring.
                    <br><br>
                    My main task for today was to hang a coat rack on the back of my door and fish the drawers in
                    Caroline’s
                    room. (The bottom keeps falling out). The latter was an easy job - just tightening the cam locks but
                    the
                    former took some ingenuity. The drill which Caroline bought specifically for me to do her list of
                    jobs
                    is ill-equipped to handle them as most require drilling into brick or concrete. However, putting
                    holes
                    in a wooden door was something which was possible. It would have been a simple job if not for the
                    cheap
                    screws which Caroline gave me which got rounded off under the first ouch of pressure. This ten
                    minute
                    job soon proliferated into an hour job and a trip to the local DIY store. A trip made infinitely
                    harder
                    when trying to communicate in a different language. Despite these hiccups, the jobs got done.
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of the day, I have been either reading or going on walks. There isn’t a surplus of
                    activities on offer since this village only spans less than one square mile but I make my own
                    entertainment. I finally have a departure date too: August 4th. I am ruminating whether to be honest
                    with Caroline or fabricate an excuse to explain my premature departure. That’s a conversation for
                    another day.

                <h5 class="date">24/07/2024 10:13 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I need to pinch myself to remind myself that this is real. I’m staying in a stranger's
                    house,
                    in a foreign place, eating local produce and walking unknown streets in the mountains of the Sierra
                    Nevada. Stockholm was an amazing experience but I had a room to myself so I could go days without
                    speaking. A self-induced isolation for when I wanted to be alone. In the year which I was there, I
                    don’t
                    think I ever heard or saw any of my neighbours. Now I get woken up by Javier screaming over
                    conceding a
                    goal in Fifa. I was addicted to Xbox as well at his age but I had the common courtesy to send
                    polemics
                    directly to my opponents instead of shouting at the TV. Diatribes are futile if there is no one to
                    hear
                    them. (I learnt that young). I am wanting to do the jobs which Caroline wants me to do, like the DIY
                    jobs, but they are more than just standard DIY. It requires knowledge which only a professional
                    tradesman has. Such as swapping a plug for a USB plug. Perhaps if we were in England, I would be
                    comfortable giving it a go because I’ve seen my Dad do it in my room, but not in Spain which runs on
                    a
                    totally different electrical system.
                    <br><br>
                    Also Caroline suggested I do this whilst she’s in a meeting which
                    indicates to me that she expects me to magically do it without turning the power off. This was the
                    first
                    time that I needed to say ‘No, I’m not doing that.’ She also wants me to change the plug socket for
                    the
                    light outside which requires a professional sparky, not a foreign volunteer found online. On paper,
                    this
                    ostensible looked like a good fit. We eat all the same foods, enjoy the same things, darts and
                    formula
                    one, but we were unclear of our expectations for each other. I wanted her to teach me Spanish which
                    she
                    doesn’t have time to do because of her labyrinthine work schedule and she wants a professional
                    tradesman
                    to come in and do a number of jobs in her apartment. Since she moved into this place a few months
                    ago,
                    she has been trying to get someone to do these jobs but I have recommended hiring someone. Her
                    countenance suddenly changed almost to say ‘well why are you staying with me then?’ I don’t think I
                    can
                    blame her. In conjunction with this, I don’t think my stay will be as long as I have anticipated.
                    All I
                    can do is enjoy the time whilst I am here. Taking photos and trying to soak up the Spanish sun.

                <h5 class="date">23/07/2024 16:34 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Caroline took Javi to his summer camp again this morning which allowed me to get up in my own time.
                    Frosties for breakfast and the morning chores. Refilling the cat bowl with food and water. Clean the
                    kitchen, and then go out with Niquito for a walk, snapping photos as I go. I am still on my UK
                    schedule
                    vis-a-vis eating routines and therefore still getting familiar with the Spanish siesta. I dropped
                    Niquito back off at the apartment and then headed out again. Caroline and Javi normally return from
                    Granada around 3pm and even though it wasn’t explicitly mentioned, Caroline was expecting food on
                    the
                    table upon her arrival. I suspected this, so this was the impetus to make sure I was out. I took my
                    camera and headed for the nearest mountains. Going out during the hottest time of the day where the
                    humidity is usually in the high thirties is certainly not something I am comfortable with. According
                    to
                    my phone, I covered 4.8km and took 5849 steps in around two hours. Catching up on my podcasts which
                    I
                    let slip during June and July is getting me through the hikes.
                    <br><br>
                    As expected, I did get a few acrimonious
                    words from Caroline who wasn’t happy about not being fed. Well tough tits. You should have
                    explicitly
                    said you wanted me to cook. I did think about cooking but there is actually nothing which I can make
                    which I know they will like. She is trying not to eat carbs and therefore restricts her diet to meat
                    and
                    vegetables but there is only a certain number of dishes one can make using the same ingredients.
                    Stir
                    fry or a stew. Normally, I see to myself because I know I am picky therefore, I eat simple to make,
                    basic meals, but I doubt my Spanish hosts would appreciate an unseasoned chicken and potatoes. After
                    my
                    caution, I wanted to do something that would prove that I am earning my keep. I went to put up a
                    trio of
                    small mirrors which I was going to hang on the walls. Caroline told me that a few screws in the wall
                    would do. Following her direction, I went to screw in the screws with the newly acquired drill she
                    had
                    bought and soon hit a brick wall. Literally. Resorting to the good-old-fashioned hammer and nail
                    technique, she proceeds to tell me that she has no nails - or a hammer. So off to a rocky start on
                    the
                    DIY front. I have managed to walk Niquito and keep the two cats alive in her absence in the mornings
                    so
                    that counts for something I hope. Was it two or three cats she had?

                <h2>Chapter 7 - A Place in the Sun</h2>
                <h5 class="date">22/07/2024 16:59 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    It has taken me a few days but I am acclimatising to the Spanish modus operandi. In the UK, I would
                    consider myself an early bird, preferring to wake up around seven or eight in order to see the sun
                    before midday. Here however, things are a little different. Because of the constant heat, most
                    Spaniards
                    wake up at eleven and go to bed in the early hours in the morning so they are benefitting from the
                    cooler air around nine or ten in the evenings. This change of routine impacts the eating schedules
                    too.
                    Caroline and Javi normally eat their main meal of the day around three pm. Thankfully, neither are
                    vegetarians, pescatarian or have any other dietary requirements. Eating in foreign places is hard
                    enough
                    for me without being limited to certain food groups. Even Niquito abides by these schedules. He is
                    trained so has to be taken out twice a day. Every morning I am out exploring the area and judging by
                    Niquito’s body language, he is not accustomed to taking circuitous walks for over twenty minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    Guejar Sierra is perched on the side of a mountain so I am going on a workout with him everyday. He
                    comes back
                    to the apartment and has his daily siesta for the next four hours. Caroline took Javi to his summer
                    camp
                    today in Granada to occupy him and she is working remotely in the park in the city. She messaged me
                    to
                    ask if I could cook some food for when they returned mid afternoon. Erm, okay. What do I cook? What
                    can
                    I cook? She left some Euros so I could buy some meat for the village so I guess that’s the plan.
                    After a
                    lot of ruminating, I opted for Shepherds pie. Traditional, British, standard, shepherd’s pie. After
                    stoving in the hot kitchen for over an hour, both Caroline and Javi seemed to enjoy it. Or if they
                    were
                    just being polite, they are incredibly good actors. Meanwhile, I’ve started doing the odd few jobs
                    around the flat; taking the bins out, washing and drying up, walking Niquito. Painting has not been
                    mentioned so I am quietly pleased about that.

                <h2>Chapter 6 - Unwanted Guestsy</h2>
                <h5 class="date">22/07/2024 9:54 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    I didn’t have the great night’s sleep last night. It was the first night that I had my sleep
                    interrupted. I went to bed around midnight along with the others and Niquito followed me into my
                    room.
                    When asked, I normally say ‘Yes, I am a dog lover’, but in reality, I’m more laissez faire when
                    around
                    them. Pushing him out the door didn’t help because then he kept scratching and purring. Do dogs
                    purr?
                    When I opened the door, he lept straight on my bed and got comfortable. Clearly, I had taken his
                    spot
                    since moving in. After pleading with him to leave, his intransigence was overwhelming. I eventually
                    acquiesced and tried to find a comfortable position around him. A couple of sleep cycles later, I
                    was
                    overheating. Niquito was resting his head on my legs and it was too hot for any interaction at all.
                    Trying my best not to kick him in the face, I manoeuvred him back to the foot of the bed. After he
                    interrupted my sleep again half an hour later, I lifted him off the bed and laid him down outside my
                    door, hoping he would be too tired to start purring again. At this point, I was overheating so I
                    opened
                    the sliding doors to get some fresh air in. Even though it was still 22 degrees outside, it did
                    help. A
                    few hours later, I was startled, waking me up yet again. This time by one of the cats had sauntered
                    into
                    my room and jumped on my bed. Letting out a manly yelp, I jumped into action to remove the feline
                    and
                    ushed her back outside. Locking the sliding doors, I was adamant that I wouldn’t be woken up again.
                    Caroline was up early to take Javi to his summer camp and with their shuffling and stomping, it woke
                    me
                    up too. I couldn’t get back to sleep so instead I got up. Taking my revenge on Niquito, I woke him
                    up
                    too and took him on a two hour hike. Little bastard won’t be waking me up again. But looking back at
                    this ordeal, it’s time for another parable:

                <h2>Chapter 5 - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h2>
                <h5>21/07/2024 14:59 CET</h5>
                <p>
                    Now that I unpacked and settled in for a few days, I can have a moment of introspection. When
                    driving up
                    to the village in Guejar Sierra, the first thing to strike me was the idyllic nature of the area.
                    The
                    roads weaved around the base of the mountains which made it a slow journey so I had time to take
                    photos
                    from the back seat. I had an address for Caroline but I hadn’t looked at it on a map. To my
                    surprise,
                    the apartment is the highest one overlooking the entire village. This may sound great and that it’s
                    an
                    expensive house, similar to royalty overlooking their citiedels but no. It is a compact flat which
                    is a
                    full workout just to get to from the village square. This is a route which I am having to do every
                    morning in order to fill up my water bottles and do my shopping. Caroline and Javier are very
                    accommodating. When they speak Spanish, they speak slowly so I can try and understand, even if they
                    are
                    not directly talking to me. We have our routines established. I normally take the dog, Niquito, out
                    for
                    his morning and evening walks whilst Caroline is working. She is a manager at a recruitment firm so
                    works around six hours a day but at different times. It is fully remote and she is liaising with
                    colleges from different countries, hence the obscure working hours. Since it is the summer holidays,
                    Javier is struggling to entertain himself. He shuts himself in his room and plays Playstation until
                    the
                    early hours of the morning to pass the time. Over the past few days he hasn’t awoken till around
                    lunch
                    so I try to be quiet around the flat. Since I have brought my camera, I have been taking plenty of
                    landscape photos on long walks. I haven’t done any of the hiking trails adorning the mountains
                    because
                    even though I can see them from the apartment, they are actually around fifteen miles away. I still
                    haven’t sussed out public transport after my debacle on the first day either. I have no reason to
                    leave
                    Guejar Sierra just yet but I will be going to explore Granada at some point with Caroline.
                    <br><br>
                    Now for my pet peeves. When I arrived, the room where I am sleeping was not cleaned. I know this is
                    a
                    small thing but it would have been appreciated if it was tidied. The previous guest who had stayed
                    for
                    around six months left a number of belongings which had started to smell in the wardrobe. The room
                    had
                    been absent for over a month so it was plenty of time to wash and hoover the room. It wouldn’t have
                    taken long given the 5sqm floor space. Because of this, I didn’t actually unpack my suitcase until
                    yesterday. I wanted the room tidy to my standards before getting settled. The unscrupulous cleaning
                    is a
                    general occurrence throughout the flat. Everything is grimey. Pots and pans and not washed, only
                    rinsed
                    before being placed back in the cupboards. Niquito obviously lives indoors because of the
                    unforgiving
                    heat outside during the day but that isn’t an excuse to not keep the general cleanliness in a
                    moderate
                    state. I was feeling a little disappointed on my second day, given the dirty nature of the
                    apartment. I
                    was maybe a little homesick too. I have always appreciated how much my parents have done for me and
                    the
                    life they have given me, but I know that I need to experience this side of life too. Not everything
                    can
                    be served to me on fine China plates. Here in Guejar Sierra, food is very different to the UK. I
                    imagine
                    it would be very different compared to Madrid too. Because it is a village, we don’t have meat in
                    supermarkets, only the village butchers so Caroline comes home with a bag of meat and when it comes
                    to
                    cooking it, I don’t know if I am looking at a sirloin steak or pork loins. Food in general has
                    always
                    been a constant adversary for me and here in Spain I know that my portion sizes have shrunk back to
                    minimal sizes. Caroline has offered to cook for me but I have very particular eating habits which I
                    know
                    have stymied me in the past, but there is not a lot I can do to assuage myself. Normally, I sort my
                    own
                    meals out and do the cleaning afterwards. Partly because I want to be helpful to earn my keep, but
                    partly because I know otherwise, the pans won’t get a thorough cleaning.
                    <br><br>
                    Caroline has kindly told me what other jobs she would like doing. Hanging a few shelves and coat
                    hooks.
                    Organising the balcony - menial tasks which I am only too happy to oblige. So far there has been no
                    mention of painting like I had originally thought which I am secretly pleased about. I have a walk
                    around the village every day and so it makes sense if I take Niquito with me. He doesn’t need much
                    exercise so I don’t take him everywhere. He also has this ignominious habit of liking his balls in
                    public but not in the apartment. He’s like some sort of quadrupedal flasher. Since he’s not neutered
                    either, he has a good time with the bollards when we pass them - and exhaust pipes.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the cleanliness issue, it is going fine so far. I have started picking up some more words in
                    Spanish even though I am not forming coherent sentences yet. The village life is quiet but the night
                    life is normally quite buzzing. Other cultural differences such as only being able to get fresh
                    water
                    from the fountains are easily adaptable to but my biggest hurdle is the food. I was having my
                    doubts, if
                    I had made the right decision to come to Guejar Sierra. Would I have been better off in the city, or
                    any
                    city for that matter. I told myself that learning Spanish would be better in a rural village though
                    right now, I am not too sure. Although it is a few weeks away, I need to start thinking about
                    getting
                    flights home before they get too expensive and then I find myself in the same position as I was when
                    flying out to Spain. However I am in two minds about when and where to go. Initially, I was wanting
                    to
                    spend at least a month here in Spain but I think food is going to be the prime reason for my early
                    departure. Secondly, I was considering flying to Madrid to spend three or four days in the capital
                    as a
                    detour. When searching on flight company websites, it is easier departing from Madrid to Newcastle
                    than
                    to London. I am fervently trying to avoid London because I know the UK train will cost more than the
                    flights combined. Whatever I choose to do, I hope I do brave it out and stay for at least one full
                    month, whether that is here in Guejar Sierra or even in Madrid too. One last revelation, Caroline is

                <p>
                    Great news, Carolina and Javier not murders or criminals. Or if they are, they are polite enough to
                    be
                    closeted murders and criminals so they don’t set the wrong tone for my arrival. Caroline is a
                    cordial
                    and affable woman. Once I finally arrived, and her meetings had finished, she gave me the tour
                    around
                    the modestly small apartment. For what it lacks in square footage, it makes up for with views. If
                    Guejar
                    Sierra proliferates into a city one day, this apartment will be like overlooking the Hollywood
                    hills.
                    Add a few more zero’s onto that price tag as well. Caroline works for a recruitment firm
                    specifically in
                    the technology sector, which is a serendipitous bit of luck. I may be calling on her services in the
                    future if I want to move to Spain. Her son, Javier, keeps himself to himself. Taciturn would be
                    erroneous to describe him. He just prefers to speak in Spanish which I am not adequate in yet. Four
                    weeks time; we’ll be speaking every day. He is a carbon copy of myself at thirteen. Addicted to
                    video
                    games and going out to play football at every opportunity. I don’t see much of him but I mostly hear
                    him. Only because he is losing at Fifa. I would go in and teach him my skills accumulated from over
                    a
                    decade of experience but as a wise man once said: Help must be solicited, not dictated to. If no one
                    famous said that, then I’m claiming it.

                    I should also mention that I didn’t accomplish the challenge of navigating to the Guejar Sierra
                    mountains. I capitulated to the heat and called an Uber. I hadn’t eaten a substantial meal, had half
                    a
                    bottle of water and a host that was busy working so couldn't come and pick me up… What would you
                    have

                <h5>18/07/2024 08:59 GMT</h5>
                <p>
                    What the hell am I doing? The realisation has only just dawned on me. I am on bus number two out of
                    four
                    in order to get to my host’s house, (that in itself is a challenge). Malaga was the best option
                    -well,
                    cheapest, so I need to travel another two or three hours to actually get to Guejar Sierra. I don’t
                    even
                    know where that is, I’m just hoping for Google maps to produce a hail Mary to save me. When viewing
                    the
                    repertory of what has happened so far. I’ve travelled to a different country under the pretence of
                    helping a random woman. I don’t have a surname, nor an address. The mutual decision for me to come
                    over
                    to help her out was only made last Saturday. Two days later we had a short video call in conjunction
                    with the Workaway website guidelines to determine whether either of us were murderers or thieves.
                    Based
                    on that hastened denouement, I booked flights and less than half a week later and I’m travelling to
                    an
                    unknown city to meet unknown people. Irrespective of my previous scruples, one thing is certain.
                    It’s
                    going to be an experience. If, by my bad fortune, she does have serial killer proclivities, I will
                    have
                    travelled an comically circuitous route just to leave the same way. Succinctly - maybe it would have
                    been prosperous to carry out further due diligence before committing. Reassuringly, she received
                    positive feedback from previous volunteers, however, they were dated over four years ago when she
                    lived
                    in a different place. Now, the cynics amongst you will now be asking, why did she leave? What was
                    the
                    impetus for the change of scenery? What or who is she running from? All will be discerned in
                    appropriate
                    time… if I live to tell the tale.
                    <br><br>
                    The important thing to remember throughout this experience is my overall goal. Conversational in
                    Spanish. Of course, I will be doing the odd few jobs, keeping the flat tidy, painting, walking the
                    dog,
                    all to earn my keep, but that still leaves a vast amount of time to myself. If I am serious about
                    being
                    fluent, I need to dedicate myself to it. That’s why I didn’t bring my iPad. It’s a constant source
                    of
                    procrastination. All I have is my laptop, camera and phone to entertain myself with. Laptop to code.
                    Camera to take landscape pictures. Phone to call a cab to leave. The next four weeks are going to be
                    the
                    most dedicated and enthusiastic I have ever been.

                <h2>Chapter 2 - Feral Beasts</h2>
                <h5>18/07/2024 08:59 GMT</h5>
                <p>
                    Why have children if you can’t contain them? Indifference is not an option when your child’s
                    behaviour
                    is so indecorous that even the stewardess needs to intervene. The three hour flight to Malaga
                    International Airport was fully booked. Customary to my airport rituals, I waited till I was the
                    last
                    one to board the plane. I do this, not because I’m superstitious or as an ominous premonition, but
                    plainly because it’s a three hour flight and I don’t want to be sat down for longer than I need to
                    be.
                    The chairs are uncomfortable, the people are unsociable and the pilots don’t even greet you onto the
                    plane anymore. My sleep deprivation reared its head at just the right time, knocking me out for two
                    thirds of the flight. All was simpatico in the cabin, until Tommy, the little raskell sat in front
                    of
                    me, started to throw a tantrum. Pandemonium. <br><br>
                    That was the end of the serenity, the mutual respect we passengers had for each other. It was every
                    man,
                    woman and child for themselves. Having been rudely
                    awoken by the screams of the feral child, it was like we had suddenly hit turbulence but instead of
                    wind, it was an anti-social contagion. The equilibrium of TUI flight 2343 was shattered. Tommy’s
                    mother
                    was deeply enjoying her latest Colleen Hoover book, (which I can hardly blame her for) and Tommy’s
                    father was engrossed in watching an orgy which normally would be deemed inappropriate, but because
                    it
                    was The Boys, no one batted an eyelid. Except the geriatric woman who had a constant look of askance
                    painted across her countenance. From my angle, I could tell if it was pleasure or disgust. Any who,
                    they
                    left Tommy running wild. The flight crew were losing their patience. I’m pretty sure they wanted to
                    restrain the kid – or eject him. Also, they were selling cigarettes on the flight. I thought this
                    was
                    expedient in this day and age. What is this, the seventies? Meanwhile, I had the guy behind me
                    swinging
                    on my chair every time he stood up. Baby’s started crying, the flight crew kept jolting me awake by
                    knocking the drinks cart into me every time they went up and down the aisle. I suppose I was
                    collateral
                    damage for when they were avoiding Tommy and his posse. My sleep was ruined with just under an hour
                    remaining. The only allegory what I can think of for this ordeal to justify telling this story is:

                <h5>18/07/2024 04:24 GMT</h5>
                <p>
                    No place is it more acceptable to be having a pint at any hour of the day than in an airport. I am
                    sitting in the departure lounge of Newcastle International Airport waiting for my gate information
                    which
                    isn’t due to be displayed for over an hour. After leisurely walking through duty free and trying on
                    a
                    few pairs of excessively priced designer sunglasses, I now have nothing but time to kill. Like with
                    all
                    flights, I never sleep well the night before. Whether it is my subconscious warning me that a
                    Lost-like
                    scenario is imminent and I need to remain vigil, or it is nerves about what I am going abroad to do.
                    My
                    head is spinning, my eyes are drowsy and, honestly, it’s a miracle I’m forming coherent sentences at
                    half four in the morning.
                    <br><br>
                    The game plan never changes. It was instilled in us as children by our fathers and their fathers
                    before
                    then and their fathers before them. ‘Get to the airport early and you can sleep when you’re there.’
                    Meanwhile, I don’t see how this is remotely possible after having to go through the ordeal of
                    airport
                    check-in. Navigating the slalom of the self check-in machines is enough to send the weakest among us
                    into a tailspin. Those of us who are blessed with being technology savvy are penalised, being thrown
                    into this maelstrom of 70s technology and a world of print out boarding passes. Newcastle Airport,
                    along
                    with most, have done their utmost best to adapt to the times, but the digital scanners are not
                    sensitive
                    enough to scan a barcode off a digital screen and I am left staring at the screen, taunting me to
                    place
                    my boarding pass in the machine. Grandma and Grandpa are smiley prodigiously as they storm by me, no
                    doubt laughing at my attempt to streamline the check-in process.
                    <br><br>
                    With the assistance of one of the two TUI staff who are overwhelmed in questions and stress, I am
                    heading for security. Feeling light as a feather with only my meticulously organised backpack. Ready
                    to
                    pour everything out for the x-rays which evidently can’t recognise the difference between a Kindle
                    and a
                    remote control bomb. Double-checking all my pockets to make sure I haven’t accidentally snuck a one
                    litre water bottle in my back pocket. I strip off, belt, shoes, jumper, glasses, only to get
                    selected
                    for a manual search anyway. ‘Would you like to see my penis here or in the back?’ It was my first
                    pat
                    down. He had a surprisingly gentle touch. Meanwhile, my tray of valuables is being checked by a
                    member
                    of the security team. She looks me up and down, judging whether I look like the type of person to
                    try
                    and pull anything beneath her radar. Her darting eyes are always on the lookout, ready to pounce at
                    the
                    first sign of trouble. She looked scary enough so she won’t be getting any trouble from me. ‘What is
                    this?’ she asks, holding my Kindle enveloped in a flowery case. ‘It’s only a Kindle,’ I replied.
                    “Kindle, huh.’ It clearly stimulated her acuitus mind. Determining it safe to board a plane, I am
                    waved
                    on. Physically unharmed but mentally confused. I promise I’m not a bad guy. I don’t deserve this
                    treatment.
                    <br><br>
                    My flight isn’t until 6:05am. It is currently 4:30. What to do, what to do. Newcastle Airport is
                    bustling and full of life. Eager Geordies looking to fly from their homeland to invade the blissful
                    shores of Magaluf or Ibiza. Every type of young thug haircut is surrounding me. I’d better keep a
                    tight
                    grasp on my laptop. They might try and steal it in order to buy a Witherspoon's breakfast. What else
                    is
                    there to do but have an idle around duty free and the overpriced Airport shops. Who walked through
                    an
                    Airport and thinks now is the perfect time to buy a six-foot tall teddy bear? Obviously the children
                    running around like it’s their first time out at night. Parents trying their best to subdue their
                    child’s excitement. ‘If you don’t behave, then we’ll be going home.’ Does this ever work or is this
                    empty threat enough to scare the child into submission? I tried to sleep, but I am too conscious one
                    of
                    these skinheads with sticky fingers will perform a daring heist for my bag. I am following my
                    father’s
                    advice to be vigilant. This untenable virgil till my gate number is displayed.
                    <br><br>
                    Airports never seem to put me at ease.. I don’t know what to do if I get there early. Normally, I
                    travel
                    light. An under-the-seat backpack with a spare pair of shorts and a t-shirt. Perfectly adequate for
                    a
                    week away. I can turn up twenty minutes before my flight is due to board and I am straight through.
                    Storming through the airport with purpose and the bystanders know this by my dominating gait.
                    However,
                    that isn’t the case this time. I am travelling to Malaga to then get the train to Granada in order
                    to
                    catch the bus to Guejar Sierra. Why you may ask? Well, I am staying with a host family which I’ve
                    found
                    on Workaway: a website which advertises cultural experiences on foreign soil. Since I returned from
                    my
                    Erasmus year in Stockholm, it has been in the back of my mind to do something like this. I knew I
                    wanted
                    to go to Spain to learn the language. That way I have something to show for my time away. A new
                    skill
                    which offers the potential to open more opportunities in my career. This was something which I
                    inevitably missed out on during the past year in Stockholm. Barricading my flat during the winter
                    months
                    to protect myself against the minus twenty weather was not what I was expecting when I left last
                    August.
                    This time, I want something to show for my time away.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, I postponed this life changing experience till after the Euros. I needed to be home to
                    watch
                    England perform dismally in the final. I might have gotten hanged if I was in Spain and by some
                    miracle,
                    we had won. Thankfully, the Spaniards will be too inebriated to notice yet another foreigner slip
                    under
                    their mist. As long as I stay clear of Barcelona because tourists are being assaulted there. Its
                    semblance is closer to Trump’s America rather than King Felipe’s Spain.
                    <br><br>
                    I intensified my search for hosts early July and started messaging an innumerable number of hosts.
                    All
                    had intriguing projects underway. After a lot of setbacks from promising placements, I finally got a
                    response from Caroline. After a few short messages and a half an hour call, Caroline decided to let
                    me
                    stay rent free in exchange for a paltry amount of work. Painting, dog walking, cooking – menial
                    tasks
                    which are time consuming for her to do. Her thirteen year old son was also mentioned on her profile
                    but
                    if a thirteen year old still needs a babysitter, I think he needs the kind of help which I can’t
                    provide.
                    <br><br>
                    Why am I doing this? The answer which I will use in job interviews would be something like, to
                    enrich my
                    knowledge of a different culture and learn the traditions and religions of the indigenous people.
                    That
                    gravitas makes recruiters think I’m staying in wood shelters and bringing hope to the poor natives.
                    In
                    contrast, there is no particular reason except for wanting to learn Spanish. Anything else I learn
                    whilst I’m there is superfluous and will no doubt be forgotten by Christmas. I did have a spell of
                    fervently learning Spanish during the pandemic but staring at a screen and translating sentences
                    such as
                    ‘the monkey is driving to the bank to meet his friends’ isn’t a likely phrase which will aid me in
                    fluency. Complete immersion is the only way to achieve my goal. The village they live in is situated
                    around twenty minutes from Granada but has all the amenities needed in order to get the necessities.
                    Caroline herself is Dutch, and because of the Dutch Calvinistic propensity to learn English, we have
                    no
                    problem communicating. Her son, Javier, however knows English although I am unsure what level of
                    proficiency he’s at. Caroline and her son were not the only hosts. There were others who I had
                    messaged
                    but for inauspicious reasons, they were not a good fit. Mainly because they had a very singular
                    image of
                    the person which they wanted. A master craftsman who will build a shed free of charge or a mechanic
                    who
                    can turn a Ford Cortina into a Mustang. That sort of thing. Caroline being fluent in English is a
                    good
                    omen as she can teach and correct my Spanish instead of having to communicate using hand signals and
                    playing charades in order to have conversations. Until I meet her, I am holding my breath for a
                    positive
                    stay.

                <p>
                    White Rabbits, white rabbits, white rabbits.

                    Unfortunately, I cannot stay in bed for the week as suggested yesterday because today I’m off to
                    London.
                    First for a catchup with Matthew and then seeing the award winning <em>Hadestown</em>. Before I go
                    though, the lecturer I emailed has agreed to be my supervisor. Better still; she has also signed off
                    on
                    my idea without recommending any changes at all! Fantastic! That means in the next four months, I
                    only
                    have one module to complete instead of two because I’ve practically completed the FYP already.

                    Update: Hadestown is spectacular, almost like a cult classic.. I knew very little about it but for
                    the
                    incessant posters plastered all over the underground and the flash of the neon lights as I walked
                    under
                    the billboard on Shaftesbury avenue. It is American folk music; reminisce of <em>Wade in the
                    Water</em>
                    or <em>The Devil of Our Time</em>. The story follows a girl, taken by Hades - King of the underworld
                    -
                    and her true love trying to find her to execute a rescue.

                    I use the term cult classic because I haven’t seen an audience respond to a musical like that since
                    the
                    release of <em>Hamilton</em> in 2016. There were Italian’s either side of me and they stood
                    applauding
                    after every showstopper. My rating: solid 8.5.

                <h2>Friday, 31th January</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the deadline has been extended to next week, Dilan and I were able to meet up to critique each
                    other's papers. We have very different approaches to the assignments, neither one is considered the
                    de
                    facto way of doing it but they are still correct. I love a 3000 word essay as nerdy as that makes
                    me.
                    After I complete the first draft with the bulk of the information, I can start editing it and add my
                    personal flair. Dilan describes it as ‘a storybook layout that has a beginning, middle and end.’ I
                    agree
                    with this; each part building up the narrative until finally culminating in an interwoven
                    denouement.
                    That’s how I’ve learnt to write, irrespective of the medium that I’m supposed to be following.
                    Essays,
                    case reviews, research proposals, they’re all the same. Fragmented bits of information arranged into
                    a
                    linear format to build a picture of the subject topic.
                    <br><br>
                    Dilan’s approach is much more succinct. Written in spoken English and concise. No equivocation or
                    verbose language. When I was reviewing his work, I twitched every time I saw a word out of place. I
                    have
                    a whole lexicon of words that I avoid in academic papers. <em>A lot of</em> can be converted to <em>a
                    plethora</em>; <em>incorrect</em> can be <em>spurious</em> or <em>erroneous</em>. They’re just
                    little
                    things that make the paper more sonorous to read. I left the library satisfied with Dilan’s stamp of
                    approval.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto this afternoon’s activities, a task that every student needs to complete nowadays - the
                    character
                    and behavioural tests of a job interview just so employers can check if we’re going to be a <em>satisfactory
                    addition</em> to their team. Not great or exceptional. <em>Satisfactory</em>. They were the words
                    verbatim on Sage’s
                    employee portal. How about giving us coding problems to check our suitability to the job or a case
                    study
                    to assess our professional proclivities in a workplace environment. No, instead they ask us to
                    complete
                    psychometric games to check our worthiness.
                    <br><br>
                    One test included hitting the spacebar as many times as I could in sixty seconds. This correlated to
                    our
                    level of determination. Another asked us to see how many words we could copy from a transcript
                    within a
                    time limit - basically a typing test. This obviously correlates to gauging our attention spans. I
                    imagine
                    they think all Gen Z struggle to focus on one task at a time given the dopamine overload we get from
                    social media. Ironically, the transcript was the company’s own diversity and inclusion policy, which
                    emphasised the importance of valuing candidates as individuals rather than reducing them to
                    arbitrary
                    metrics.
                    <br><br>
                    No questions or scenarios even remotely close to what the job specification included and yet upon
                    concluding the games, I’m rewarded with a comprehensive personal profile outlining my strengths and
                    shortcomings:
                    <br><br>
                    <em>“You are an exceptionally kind and empathetic individual with a high risk tolerance, making you
                        a
                        supportive and bold decision-maker. However, you struggle with focus and exerting consistent
                        effort,
                        often choosing tasks based on impulse rather than necessity. While well-liked and adventurous,
                        your
                        success may depend on strategies to improve concentration and follow-through.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Quite a report, especially since no verbal questions were asked.
                    <br><br>
                    Just when I thought I’d had a taxing afternoon jumping through administrative hoops, I went to the
                    radio
                    studio to produce Lantern’s show. First thirty seconds in the studio, Lantern tells me she’d been
                    off
                    her antidepressants this week and she’s depressed. Who’d have guessed? She said she didn’t want to
                    talk
                    about it and then proceeded to talk about it for the next ten songs. I thought about pulling the
                    fire
                    alarm.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, someone was reading my thoughts - or I have the power of manifestation, because at that
                    moment, the alarm blared to life on its own, offering me a perfect excuse to leave. Clearly I’m not
                    as
                    empathic as my psychometric tests suggested.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, it’s eight o’clock and I’m totally shattered. It’s the end of the module and it’s half term
                    next
                    week. Therefore I’m crawling into bed and not resurfacing for at least nine days. What a life I
                    lead.

                    The supervisor has finally emailed me back about supervising my final year project. She wants more
                    details regarding the project's suitability for her. Excuse me? I thought as soon as I request a
                    supervisor, I will get that supervisor. They don’t get the option to pawn us off to the next person.
                    If
                    that is the case, this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Especially since I am very
                    close to
                    the completion of my FYP, (final year project). I just need a supervisor to sign off on my idea as
                    it is
                    so I don’t need to undertake radical changes to fit their project specs.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, my shaver came today so now I look less like uncle Albert and more like Charlie
                    Hunham
                    again. The moment I stepped out of my room with my tidy beard and my hair washed, I get compliments
                    from Esther and Aswany. They clearly haven’t seen me look presentable in a while.
                    <br><br>
                    I have spent the past week perfecting my essays. 1000 words on ethical pitfalls of the proliferation
                    of
                    AI in industrial settings and a 3000 word proposal detailing the developmental methodologies and
                    processes that should be implemented to ensure scalability, quantum bifurcation and legal
                    compliance.
                    (It’s not as daunting as it sounds, I promise). Just as I have everything perfect, every word
                    meticulously chosen and every reference checked and double checked, I go to submit and in bold
                    crimson
                    across the screen: <em>The Deadline has been extended 1 WEEK. Submission due 07/02/25.</em>
                    Ridiculous!
                    <br><br>
                    I am speculating here, but I think because of the obfuscation during the seminar last Tuesday, our
                    module lead has decided to be lenient.
                    <br><br>
                    I am vexed. I’m in the small minority of people who can actually read. I understood the coursework
                    after
                    I read it the first time in December. We have had ample time to query, question, protest and plead
                    with
                    our seminar tutors about the assignments but the angry mob only voiced their concerns for the first
                    time
                    last week. This was not a genuine plea, nor a true representation of the level of difficulty of the
                    coursework. It was a deputation of students jumping on the bandwagon to ambush the module leader.
                    <em>‘If
                        enough people complain, she is bound to change the course’</em> was the misguided mantra.
                    <br><br>
                    Two hundred students are undertaking the module; it was made unequivocally clear to us how important
                    participation in all the seminars was and yet each seminar had a maximum of eight students
                    attending.
                    Now, it’s judgement day and the townspeople aren’t ready. I agree attendance should be mandatory
                    however, it undermines Ismini’s statement since my seminar tutor was dwelling on the wrong areas for
                    the
                    first half of the module.
                    <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, the assignments were understandable despite the complaints in the forum: <em>‘the
                    grammar
                    is confusing’. ‘The questions are ambiguous’. </em>So it’s not an issue with the questions, it’s an
                    issue with the wording? Personally, I am under the fervent belief that I could have completed these
                    assignments back in Darlington by reading up on the subject matters myself. Regardless of my
                    personal
                    opinions, I have the coursework finished, albeit a week early. Because of that, I can actually enjoy
                    my
                    week off instead of writing about workplace development strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m looking at starting the third draft of my novel. Since my FYP is practically done, I’ll have
                    considerable time to work on it. Exciting, I know.

                <h2>Wednesday, 29th January</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s always that one bad apple in the game that upset the equilibrium of the group. Unlike Monday
                    nights, Wednesday afternoons are more convivial on the futsal court. Laughing and joking. Attempting
                    skills, light tackling. Nothing egregious. However, there is one person who takes everything too
                    seriously.
                    <br><br>
                    Picking the teams, trying to implement tactics, yelling when we stray out of formation - <em>on a
                    five-a-side court</em>. Unilaterally deciding who plays, who’s in goal and who’s on the bench. Going
                    as
                    far as acting as the quasi referee when he’s on the sidelines. The ironic part is, he’s probably the
                    worst on our team. I can only imagine what would happen to him if he tried this on a Monday evening.
                    Legs broken, stretchered off probably.
                    <br><br>
                    After an hour of playing under his draconian leadership, on a solid 0-5 losing streak, the rest of
                    the
                    team mutinied. After singling out our midfielder as the worst player, and publicly criticising him,
                    this
                    tipped everyone over the edge. Since they all speak Arabic, I can only deduce what they were saying
                    from
                    their animated body language and the passionate roars in their inflections.
                    <br><br>
                    Much to everyone’s dismay, the lone ranger didn’t capitulate; leading to two players switching
                    teams,
                    one deciding he didn’t want to play and one leaving. I was stood by Emmanual who was translating
                    what he
                    could of the shouting. We merged into two teams and guess who didn’t have a team. Not to worry, he
                    decided what team he wanted to be on and ordered a bib off one of the players.
                    <br><br>
                    I was incredulous. To set your stall out the way he did and yet still miss easy chances, and lose
                    the
                    ball as often as he did, I wouldn’t be so confident.

                    After another half an hour of his antics, we called time of death on our fun. I wish there was an
                    allegory or poignant ending to this anecdote but there isn’t. There just isn’t. It feels like it’s
                    been
                    a long day but it’s only 15:50.

                <p>
                    Demon Magazine February Edition is close to being released therefore I found myself in an editorial
                    meeting this morrow with Jess, Molly and Amina. The brains behind the operation, <em>ostensibly</em>.
                    The past editions have been permeated with spelling errors and formatting issues. Add that to the
                    copyrighted images in conjunction with the articles, I’m surprised the university hasn't been issued
                    a warning or a fine yet.
                    <br><br>
                    As editor-in-chief, it is under Jess’ purview to send the finished mag to the publishers. As the
                    release date is only round the corner, we thought Jess had ordered some previews when she turned up
                    with a
                    package. Not quite. The creative writing team—Bronze and Evan—put together a booklet showcasing
                    their work. While their intentions may have been admirable (a portfolio for interviews, perhaps?),
                    the
                    execution was lacking. The booklet’s formatting looked like it had been handled by a novice in an IT
                    lesson: misaligned text, blurry images, and inconsistent margins. On top of that, the stories
                    themselves were riddled with grammar mistakes. It reminds me of the class swat wanting to present
                    their
                    lacklustre work that they think is amazing. They even had the audacity to put the Demon Mag emblem
                    on the cover
                    to signify the association with the University Media Group.
                    <br><br>
                    Creative writing is a difficult task, (any writing is a difficult feat), which is why I am
                    scrupulous about what I release. Everything is edited, and at the bare minimum: spellchecked. Turns
                    out, these
                    two, who are dating, are less assiduous and publish everything the moment it is written.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I’m not editor-in-chief, it’s not my concern. I’m a bystander so I can sit and laugh at this
                    shambolic display. Jess, less so. Since she’s the boss, everything needs to go through her in order
                    to get published. She wanted to resign after seeing the finished products. Luckily she ordered the
                    bare
                    minimum: 20 copies! I’ve taken one just so I have a record of the quality of writing that I am
                    lumbered with in the Demon mag.

                <p>
                    I watched <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> this afternoon before the Boro game. A great film but confusing.
                    Classic Stanley Kubrick. <em>“We should be grateful for our adventures, if they were real or in our
                    dreams.”</em> A lot of subconscious text about reality and psychology. It’s similar to <em>Belle De
                    Jour</em> and I’ve already journaled thoroughly about what a mind-bender that was.
                    <br><br>
                    My kitchen has become a lot busier this new year. Aswany has friends round some evenings and they
                    have
                    some sort of agreement about sharing meals. I don’t mind this but they use a lot of spices – spices
                    that
                    hurt my eyes after being exposed for the thirty seconds it takes me to put my sausages in the oven.
                    I’m
                    starting to sense that it is a deterrent. When they’re not making Sarin gas in the Kitchen, Esther’s
                    starting having more meals in the apartment because her friends have finished their Masters’ degrees
                    and
                    therefore have left Leicester, so she’s using all four hobs to create some abomination. I can’t even
                    just slip in to throw some frozen food in the oven because my other roommate, Summer, is batch
                    cooking
                    brownies. Why brownies?? What made this worse is there was no offer of sharing these delights in the
                    form of reparation for hindering me. No, it’s everyone for themselves. What tipped me over the edge
                    and
                    led me to call a flat meeting tonight, was between the three of them, they’ve used all of my milk.
                    Now I
                    don’t mind sharing but if I can’t have my Weetabix after a long day coding, there’s going to be hell
                    to
                    pay. Let me tell you, those brownies suddenly made an appearance.

                <p>
                    So, my lecturer has given up. There’s a week of content left, but he’s decided to release the
                    materials
                    early so we can “read it and get it over with.” Those weren’t his exact words, but his body language
                    said it all. This is his first time teaching the module, and I suspect it’ll be his last. He’s ready
                    to
                    retire, and dragging himself into a seminar with fewer than five students just isn’t worth it.
                    Honestly,
                    I can’t blame him.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve been attending every class, and I think that’s why he’s grading on a curve. My first assignment
                    scored a 95%, which felt overly generous given the gaps I left. If this is some kind of concealed
                    favoritism—showing up in exchange for lenient grades—I’ll take it. Seems like a fair trade.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening, I spent two hours giving Lantern a history lesson in the radio studio. It’s ironic—she
                    hosts a music show but doesn’t know much music beyond 2005. <em>Bloody millennials.</em>I started in
                    the
                    50s
                    with Elvis, worked through The Beatles and The Who in the 60s, and climbed the decades from there:
                    Elton
                    John, Queen, and Zeppelin for the 70s; U2, The Jam, and The Clash for the 80s (the golden age, if
                    you
                    ask me); and Oasis, Green Day, and Red Hot Chili Peppers for the 90s. By the time we hit The Ting
                    Tings
                    and The Killers, our slot was over, and Lantern was clearly ready to escape.
                    <br><br>
                    As producer, I call the shots on what goes on air. If I leave it to Lantern, it’s all Pokémon theme
                    tunes and songs recycled on Glee. Not on my watch.
                    <br><br>
                    I stayed back to produce Jamie’s show and finally caught up with him after Christmas, but the studio
                    soon descended into chaos. Angel barged in with eight of the refreshers crowd, all piling into the
                    room,
                    leaning on my control panel, and knocking sliders out of place. A few of them are talking about
                    starting
                    podcasts, which I’ll probably end up producing. That’s the only reason I bit my tongue instead of
                    telling them to pi... politely find their way out.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, Mother thought watching The Traitors was more important than catching up with her
                    youngest son that she hadn’t spoken to in almost a month. Priorities eh.

                <h2>Thursday, 23nd January</h2>
                <p>
                    Since it’s my final year in Leicester, I’ve decided to make the most of the cultural events that are
                    unique to this city. First up: the Leicester Comedy Festival. To kick off the festivities, I went to
                    see
                    Jason Manford on his tour at De Montfort Hall.
                    <br><br>
                    Scanning the room, I quickly realised I must have been the youngest person there by at least two
                    decades. Manford clearly draws a different crowd compared to someone like Jimmy Carr. When I saw
                    Jimmy
                    Carr with Nat and Mehmet, the audience was packed with young adults and youths doing their best to
                    pretend they were adults. Tonight, though, the vibe was all beer guts and white hair. The man
                    sitting
                    next to me had a walking stick. He either struggled to hear or found some of the references too
                    modern
                    for his carefully curated lexicon. Still, I found it amusing that his wife knew what a nonce was.
                    <br><br>
                    Manford’s show was a completely different experience from Jimmy Carr’s. While Carr delivers
                    rapid-fire,
                    edgy one-liners, Manford leans into anecdotes and observational humor. His set has a smooth, linear
                    flow, tying everything together in a satisfying denouement. I’ve always thought of him as one of
                    those
                    comedians I’d happily watch if he was on TV, but not someone I’d go out of my way to see. That said,
                    Leicester doesn’t offer a comedy buffet, so when a BBC game show host comes to De Montfort Hall, you
                    take the chance. For £18, it was a steal—especially since I upgraded myself to a vacant seat after
                    the
                    warm-up act wrapped up.

                <p>
                    One year ago today, I watched <em>Letter to an Unknown Woman</em> & <em>Casablanca</em> for the
                    first
                    time. My introduction to the Golden Era of Hollywood. Since then, I have watched 193 movies in this
                    calendar year; 129 of those from before 1970. 57 from before 1950. 25 Warner Bros. produced; 23 MGM,
                    18
                    Paramount. 16 starring Cary Grant, 15 starring Bogart. 13 directed by Alfred Hitchcock. 8 with Jimmy
                    Stewart, 6 with Fonda. 4 written or directed by communists, 3 films classed as propaganda
                    productions. 2
                    that made me cry and only one with Bogart not wearing a suit or a fedora.
                    <br><br>
                    To celebrate this momentous achievement, I indulged in another cinematic gem: <em>Now, Voyager</em>.
                    Arguably the granddaddy of all "girl gets a makeover, gains confidence, becomes a strong independent
                    woman" movies. A trope so ubiquitous today, it's hard to believe this was groundbreaking. Of course,
                    any
                    film with Bette Davis, I approach with a healthy dose of skepticism, given my lingering trauma from
                    <em>Whatever
                        Happened to Baby Jane?</em> I perhaps should have watched Bette Davis’ film catalogue in
                    chronological
                    order and save the horror for the end.
                    <br><br>
                    But hey, at least I learned what Victor Laszlo got up to after fleeing Casablanca. And it turns out
                    Captain Renault found his true calling as a psychiatrist after the Police too. Who knew?

                <h2>Tuesday, 21st January</h2>
                <p>
                    Just as I am trying to get back into the swing of things after an intense four days of programming;
                    I
                    have two essays due in ten days; accumulating a 4000 word count. I have a shiver that runs down my
                    spine
                    whenever I see apostrophes because they were causing us a plethora of issues over the weekend.
                    Computer
                    code uses apostrophes to differentiate text from system commands but we were using them in their
                    literal
                    sense in the context of language which beleaguered our AI models for 48 hours straight.
                    <br><br>
                    The seminar detailing the specifics of these assignments this morning was not as informative as I
                    would
                    have liked. But that seems to be the common threat surrounding this module. The purpose of the
                    assignments is to think of a solution to an IT problem and justify our answers. This was clearly too
                    perplexing for many students because the general consensus from the seminar was ‘this is too
                    confusing’,
                    ‘we don’t know what you want from us’, ‘it needs to be explained more thoroughly’. Personally, I
                    thought
                    it was all very dramatic.
                    <br><br>
                    Because there are no right or wrong answers so we’re getting graded on our reasoning skills,
                    everyone
                    was panicking because the solution isn’t spoon fed to us in black and white. We need to read
                    research
                    papers and articles to deduce our own conclusions. Clearly, these instructions were too inscrutable
                    for
                    final year computer science students.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, maintenance installed a new oven for us today. I’m not ashamed to say that I did a
                    little
                    dance when I found this unexpected surprise. Is this a sign that I’m getting older? Uncontainable
                    excitement over a kitchen appliance? Maybe so - but my chicken nuggets have never tasted so
                    delicious.

                <h2>Sunday or Monday, the whatever of January - 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, you may be asking where have I been for the past four days? A weekend break away to a European
                    capital? This time last year, I was making a spontaneous trip to Vienna. Was I visiting more of the
                    UK,
                    Cardiff or Manchester? Maybe a sojourn to London to tick off more Shakespeare plays from my
                    checklist?
                    Well, actually I haven’t moved.
                    Starting last Thursday, I competed in my first Hackathon. That’s right, I’m officially a hacker.
                    <br><br>
                    For those of you that are ignorant of the most prestigious event on the ethical hacker’s calendar, a
                    Hackathon is an event where teams come together to collaborate intensively on projects. These
                    projects
                    are typically software development, hardware engineering, or other creative problem-solving
                    activities.
                    There are no constraints but one guideline: Projects must use real-time processing. This is as it
                    sounds; we must build a project that operates in dynamic environments, processing and responding to
                    inputs or events as they occur. (These are things like ride-sharing apps, live-streaming websites or
                    online videogames.)
                    <br><br>
                    So the seven of us gathered in Gateway House where we had access to cloud storage, a stable internet
                    connection and the backing of the De Montfort Computing faculty. We were competing online so we had
                    a
                    camera on us for four days straight; hence why we needed a stable internet connection. We had 96
                    hours
                    to plan, design, code, test, and present our project to the invigilators who I imagine were just
                    monitoring our screens for the entirety of that time.
                    <br><br>
                    Our project was a language app similar to google translate. We utilised AI and machine learning
                    language
                    models so a user can speak into it and the NLP (Natural Language Processor) can translate it into
                    any of
                    the pre-selected languages. In the four days we were coding this, we managed to gain functionality
                    for
                    over thirty languages. <em>Impressive, huh.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Because this is a four day Hackathon, we didn’t move from room 3.91 for the majority of that time.
                    It’s
                    not like we could just take a few hours off to get some fresh air. When we weren’t working, we were
                    sleeping. I never thought I would spend an evening cooped up inside a university building. It’s
                    nothing
                    like one would expect as a child; being able to roam freely around an abandoned building. Dilan and
                    the
                    other committee members from the Hacking society had overnight bags. <em>This clearly wasn’t their
                    first
                    rodeo.</em> I live five minutes away from the university so I came back to my bed every night but
                    Saturday. Campus security knew we were there so didn’t call the Police on us when we were entering
                    the
                    building at four o’clock in the morning.
                    <br><br>
                    Because the university needed to monitor us over the four days, we had brief respites when the
                    health
                    and wellbeing officer came in to check on our mental states. I thought this was a little extreme and
                    ironic when they came in every few hours. On Thursday, we were all jovial, excited and fuelled on
                    achieving potential greatness and immortality in the world of Computer Hackers. Friday, we were less
                    enthusiastic and some of the lads were getting tired after coding for twenty-four hours straight. I
                    went
                    home to sleep so I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. Saturday was intense. There was a lot to do and
                    not
                    a lot was working. Sunday we were descending into madness. MADNESS I TELL YOU; MADNESS.
                    <br><br>
                    I have never been so sleep deprived. Saturday and Sunday merged into one. We were all sleeping for
                    only
                    an hour at a time so we were all irritable and emotional. Jack was actually in tears when he was
                    pleading with his code to work. <em>“Speak to it softly, see if that makes a difference.”</em> He
                    was in
                    no mood for my witty remarks; as I later found out when he threw a keyboard at me.
                    <br><br>
                    The vexation on Dilan’s face when he wandered over and I was watching the football was a sight to
                    behold. <em>“Harry, do your job or I’ll hack your laptop.”</em> Normally, this would just be an
                    empty
                    threat but I’m sitting with six hackers who have been infiltrating security systems since before
                    they
                    had all their adult teeth.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long Saturday night, crying on the floor, sleeping for brief intervals under the desks,
                    words
                    don’t even look right anymore. A mixture between coding languages and looking at languages to
                    implement
                    into our app, I couldn’t think coherently. Why do words have one pronunciation but two spellings?
                    <em>Queue.</em>
                    Is it a word? Why isn’t it spelt like <em>‘cue’</em>. Why is the English language a labyrinth of
                    silent
                    letters, bizarre rules, and exceptions to every rule? Why does <em>‘colonel’</em> sound like <em>‘kernel’</em>?
                    Why do <em>‘tear’</em> and <em>‘tear’</em> mean two completely different things? <em>To,
                    two </em>&<em>too.
                    Their, there, they’re. THESE DON’T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE.</em> Why can’t we just use <em>Newspeak</em>
                    from Orwells’ <em>nineteen-eighty-four</em>?
                    <br><br>
                    Sunday we were as coherent as zombies. We made the decision to get as much sleep as possible before
                    we
                    presented on Sunday afternoon - or Dave (the Health & Wellbeing officer doing the rounds) forcefully
                    instructed us. We managed to get everything working and the presentation went well.
                    <br><br>
                    We placed 7th out of 101 universities and private groups across the country. Hardy surprisingly
                    given
                    six out of seven of our team had real-world experience through internships at IBM, Barclays, Visa
                    and
                    Meta. Very valuable experience, but not to worry because I brought my invaluable experience of doing
                    an
                    erasmus year in Stockholm to the table…
                    <br><br>
                    So that was my past four days - five days. What day is it? I’ve still not fully caught up on my
                    sleep
                    because I can’t sleep during the day. I think maintenance has been in the kitchen doing repairs all
                    afternoon. <em>The one day I could do with them pissing off…</em>

                <p>
                    Aswany! That’s roommate A’s name! I finally overheard it while she was cooking for a friend she had
                    over. I was in the kitchen - warming up a tomato soup dish I had frozen over the weekend - but I
                    couldn’t stop to chat anyway, because the spices that she was frying were actually causing me pain.
                    By
                    the time the microwave pinged, my eyes were burning, and I was practically crying.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening marked the second meeting for our upcoming Paris trip. We’ve now been divided into
                    groups,
                    each assigned a specific task to research and present during our third meeting. My group is
                    responsible
                    for exploring restaurants and activities. Naturally, I’d prefer to keep the itinerary light, leaving
                    ample room for my own adventures. However, I can’t deny the allure of persuading the group to align
                    with
                    my plans. After all, if the stars align, there’s a chance DMUGlobal could cover travel and expenses.

                <p>
                    I feel like such a twelve-year-old again. I walk into the kitchen, and there are all three of my
                    roommates cooking. Not together, like you’d picture in some wholesome sitcom, but separately—which
                    means
                    there’s food EVERYWHERE. Meanwhile, I wander in, grab my chicken nuggets, throw them in the oven,
                    and
                    I’m done.
                    <br><br>
                    I couldn’t help but notice the irony of it, seeing as I’m the oldest and the <em>man of the
                    house.</em>
                    God, that’s old-fashioned. <em>Gather round the wireless, bairns. Pick of the Pops will be on soon.
                    Queue up the cassette player and get ready to hit record the moment the DJ shuts up. And while we
                    wait,
                    let me tell you the legend of tape recorders and dial-up internet.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    All three of them had their headphones in. I thought the games night we had on Sunday might’ve been
                    the
                    start of something, but no—it’s back to the status quo ante. Give them time.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, I have been busy with my FYP (final year project) today - ignoring the fact that the
                    module doesn't even start for another three weeks. I don’t have a supervisor confirmed yet but I
                    know
                    presciently, if I show them a completed project in week two, they’ll do their best to come up with
                    some
                    more superfluous features for me to add just so they can see that I’ve completed some additional
                    programming under their tutelage. I’ll have to momentarily delete pages and re-add them
                    incrementally so
                    I can show them that progress is being made; even if it is a convoluted way of approaching things.

                <h2>Monday, 13th January</h2>
                <p>
                    I ventured into the Watershed for my first game of football in ages and swiftly rediscovered why I
                    don’t
                    play as much as I used to in my days at Stockholm University. Back then, the sessions were a paragon
                    of
                    organisation. The sports hall staff presided over each game; everyone knew the rules, the format,
                    and,
                    crucially, their place.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrast that with tonight’s shambles. Here, Futsal is run by the Futsal society—a group whose
                    collective
                    competence appears inversely proportional to their enthusiasm. Rule number one of the evening: there
                    are
                    no
                    rules. No one seems to know what’s happening, and any attempt at structure is about as effective as
                    a
                    blind
                    referee. Bibs were distributed, but apparently, wearing them is optional, making it neon impossible
                    to
                    pick
                    out a teammate in this maelstrom of strangers.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I like to think I’m a reasonable man who seeks a gentle runabout—a convivial match where the
                    only
                    bruises are to one’s ego. Alas, what transpired was more akin to guerrilla warfare. The participants
                    were
                    gym lads who tackled like rhinos, clattering into everyone who was more nimble than they were - so
                    everyone.
                    Knee-high challenges, stamping on ankles, double-footed lunges. Challenges were made with the same
                    enthusiasm one might reserve for a medieval joust, and the offside rule was apparently a concept too
                    avant-garde for this crowd.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of avant-garde, there was a goalkeeper who took the notion of physicality to a new frontier
                    by
                    literally kicking players in protest of an "offside" goal. An offside goal! In indoor football! The
                    irony
                    was not lost on me that more English was spoken during my Stockholm days than in this local melee,
                    despite
                    it occurring in England.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to rise above it all. Really, I did. But after nutmegging the same lad thrice, he decided
                    enough
                    was
                    enough and launched into me with a challenge that was less “competitive spirit” and more “I’m out
                    for
                    blood.” The first two tackles I shrugged off with the magnanimity of a saint, but the third—executed
                    at
                    thigh height—was too much. I’m generally a calm fellow, but even I have my limits.
                    <br><br>
                    Which brings us to the regrettable aerial duel. If you ask me now if I regret going into that 50/50
                    battle, <span id="style1" style="font-size: 10px">with my elbow;</span> I would probably say yes.
                    Should
                    I
                    have sat out earlier, when the tone of the game turned gladiatorial? Definitely. But it was a
                    teachable
                    moment—retribution is a powerful force, just like my elbow.
                    <br><br>
                    Naturally, my act of appeasement marked the evening’s denouement. A staff member intervened,
                    reminding
                    us
                    that this was intended to be a light-hearted way to stay active, not a prelude to civil unrest. As
                    we
                    trudged off the court in ignominy, he added, “If you’re keen to keep fighting, my new boxing class
                    starts at
                    eight.”
                    <br><br>

                    Esther returned from her Christmas break today, radiating cheer. University of Leicester students
                    always
                    seem this way—until the next term begins, and they’re reminded it’s just as challenging as the last.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned yesterday, our affable new roommate proposed a quasi-family meal this evening. Is this
                    the
                    beginning of genuine interpersonal friendships or simply the honeymoon phase of Roommate A’s tenure
                    in
                    Leicester? Whatever the case, the evening turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. As expected, Summer
                    was
                    absent throughout the evening, only materialising for a few moments for a snack break. At this
                    point, I
                    think she’s being purposely taciturn.
                    <br><br>
                    We played charades in the lounge, swapped anecdotes, and made memories—the sort of picturesque
                    student
                    life I thought only existed on the glossy covers of housing brochures. Esther even brought her
                    projector,
                    and we ended the evening watching <em>Dr. No.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    At one point, when Roommate A left the room, (I really must find out her name before it gets too
                    late!);
                    Esther leaned over and commented that my beard suited me. Clearly, this vixen has intentions of
                    wooing
                    me.

                    Finally spoke to my new roommate. She did tell me her name but I genuinely cannot remember it. She’s
                    from India but grew up in Qatar. She seems cordial and very convivial. Amusingly, she was perplexed
                    when
                    I told her that we don’t do apartment game nights or pub quizzes together. She did have the same
                    cold
                    welcome from Summer which I can’t say I’m surprised about. She spends the majority of the time with
                    her
                    headphones on and only appears in the kitchen for noodles or takeaways. Anyway, roommate A, as I'll
                    call
                    her temporarily, has suggested going out one day next week for a tete-a-tete.

                    I was back in the radio studio this evening, and honestly, I’ve been itching to get my hands back on
                    the
                    controls all week. Lantern, my presenter, was sitting across from me as usual. She kicked off the
                    show
                    with her usual energy, introducing the segment and smoothly transitioning into tonight’s playlist.
                    The
                    moment her mic was off, she turned to me and said with a gleeful grin, <em>“I made someone just as
                    depressed as me today.”</em> Ugh, seriously? Guess we’re diving into the new year just as we left
                    the
                    last one. I really need to find a way onto someone else’s show—it’s exhausting trying to laugh and
                    smile
                    politely for two hours every Friday.
                    <br><br>
                    On a brighter note, we (DMU Hackers) just got the green light from DMU Security to run an
                    infiltration
                    exercise on one of the campus buildings. The wheels are turning now, and once the Leicester Police

                    Division is looped in and gives the final go-ahead, we’ll be off. When I say “infiltrate,” I mean
                    we’ll
                    be working to penetrate the building’s IT systems. This involves using tools like IP addresses,
                    subnet
                    masks, virtual networks, packet tracking, and a whole bunch of other tech wizardry to breach the
                    servers.

                    If this were the real deal, the goal would be to gain access, modify, or even delete sensitive data
                    on
                    those servers. But thankfully, this isn’t a Hollywood-style hackathon—this is a controlled exercise
                    under the watchful eyes of DMU Security. Our mission is simple: break in, identify security flaws,
                    and
                    help patch them up. Still, it’s exciting to be trusted with poking around the university’s IT
                    infrastructure.

                <h2>Thursday, 9th January</h2>
                <p>
                    Today marked my first seminar back with our antiquated professor, a man whose teaching feels like he
                    could tell us what it was like discovering fire all those years ago. He got the job based on three
                    papers he wrote during the dot-com boom of the late nineties—an era when the internet was
                    revolutionary,
                    and the IT sector was riding high. But nearly three decades later, with the industry now rooted in
                    AI
                    and quantum computing, he’s still clinging to defunct companies and obsolete frameworks. Worse, he’s
                    shoehorned his old research into the curriculum to ensure he profits from our suffering.
                    <br><br>
                    In a misguided attempt to make up for teaching us outdated material before Christmas, he’s now
                    drowning
                    us in work: fifteen research papers, four case analyses, seven literature reviews, and two textbooks
                    we’re expected to loan from the library. Yes, the <em>library</em>. We’re studying Computer Science,
                    and
                    we’re still reliant on tangible documents. The irony isn’t lost on me.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of the seminar, he cornered Dilan and me for feedback. I jumped in first—thankfully, as
                    Dilan’s justified disdain might have been less tactfully expressed. I managed to voice our concerns
                    diplomatically, avoiding outright insult while not absolving him either. Hopefully, our magnanimity
                    will
                    count for something when he’s marking our assignments. For now though, I have an awful lot of
                    reading to
                    do.

                <h2>Wednesday, 8th January</h2>
                <p>Less than 24 hours in Leicester, and I’m already back on a train to London. My Shakespeare matinee
                    streak
                    continues, and today it’s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> and <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> on
                    the
                    schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    First stop: Trafalgar Theatre. I’ve been here before—it’s where I saw <em>The Duchess</em> with
                    Jodie
                    Whittaker—so I knew what to expect from the space and its tech. The stage backdrop doubles as a
                    projection screen, and while the effects were fun, they didn’t really add anything to the story.
                    (Same
                    as with <em>The Duchess</em>, honestly.)
                    <br><br>
                    Tracy-Ann Oberman played Shylock, the Jewish moneylender who demands a pound of flesh when a loan
                    isn’t
                    repaid. She was amazing. But this version of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> was... complicated.
                    It’s
                    set in 1936, and while Shylock is still supposed to be the antagonist, the other characters are part
                    of
                    the British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley. So, how are we meant to feel when Shylock gets
                    tricked out of her bond—the one she’s rightfully owed? Are we happy because the “protagonists” got
                    away
                    with it, or horrified because the fascists outsmarted the Jew?
                    <br><br>
                    They leaned into this tension hard. There were scenes showing protests and vandalism against
                    Shylock’s
                    home and possessions (not in the original text) and some added lines that highlighted the casual
                    antisemitism of the time. It made the stakes feel a lot higher.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, after the usual ending, there was a twist. Oberman delivered a monologue about her
                    great-grandmother, who fought the fascists when they tried to evict Jews from London neighborhoods
                    in
                    1936. It was clearly aimed at the audience, urging kindness and acceptance of different cultures. It
                    felt a bit tacked on—like an addendum to the play—but at least they kept it to the end instead of
                    working it into the story itself.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> has always been one of my favorites because of how strong the story
                    is.
                    This version was wildly different but still stayed true to the main themes. It’s definitely sticking
                    with me. That said, I couldn’t figure out who I was supposed to root for: the Jewish moneylender
                    who’s
                    out for literal blood, or the fascists who manipulate her and walk away unscathed. It’s messy, but
                    maybe
                    that’s the point.
                    <br><br>
                    Next up: <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. But before we get into the magic of the play, let me
                    just
                    say—the Barbican is a maze. The neighborhood is pristine, upper-class, and charming but not in a
                    presumptuous way. But for a tourist? Not exactly user-friendly. I spent a good half hour wandering
                    around before finally tracking down the theatre.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, onto the show: It was fantastic. There’s a reason why <em>Midsummer</em> is one of
                    Shakespeare’s
                    greatest hits. The themes are straightforward, which makes it the perfect playground for different
                    interpretations. This production ran three hours but felt like no time at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Quick digression: the Barbican Theatre itself? Weird setup. The tiers are super narrow - two or
                    three
                    rows max - but they wrap all the way around to the stage corners. It’s like the Globe, but without
                    the
                    charm. I was up in the fourth tier, and the view made me feel a little dizzy, peering over the edge
                    of
                    the balcony. By the second half, I’d had enough and made a bold move. I shuffled my way down to the
                    first-row stalls. Yep, the £270 seats. Claimed them like I belonged there all along. Do anything
                    with
                    confidence and people will not question it. And honestly? Worth it. I was so close I could feel the
                    actors’ presence—literally. The swish of Lysander’s cloak brushed past me, and I could practically
                    hear
                    the creak of Demetrius’ boots as he stomped across the stage. I even caught the subtle twitch of
                    Mathew
                    Baynton’s eyelid while he was playing dead. Forget immersive theatre—this was Shakespeare in high
                    definition.
                    <br><br>
                    This production of Midsummer was pure joy from start to finish. The boys get the girls, they have a
                    dance, the King gives his blessing for his daughter to marry the man she loves and they all live
                    happily
                    ever after. Shakespeare in a nutshell. Puck wrapped it up with a perfect poetic soliloquy, leaving
                    us
                    with smiles and a renewed belief in the magic of live theatre.
                    <br><br>
                    Out of all the trips I’ve made to London over the past few months, these shows rank near the top.

                <p>
                    The new year has barely begun, and Leicester has already decided to humble me. I stepped into my
                    flat,
                    greeted not by warm vibes or resolutions, but by the cold, harsh reality of a broken oven and hob.
                    Barely 2025 and my last semester in Leicester is off to a rocky start. I trotted down to the office
                    to
                    see what they know and Connor has assured me, he’s on the case.
                    <br><br>
                    While I was there, I also learned a bit more about my new roommate. Female. Born 2002. Masters
                    student
                    at UoL, studying Media. That’s all I know. Oh, and that Marvin isn’t returning. RIP to the cutlery
                    thief
                    and good riddance. And cheers to Unite Students for their stellar adherence to GDPR. Asking if
                    anyone
                    had moved in somehow got me their life story. I mean, I basically know her shoe size and favorite
                    snack
                    at this point—just missing a name. Mysterious.

                <h2>Saturday, 14th December</h2>
                <p>
                    I always sleep better in Liam’s bed than in my own. I really need to find out where he got his
                    duvet.
                    This morning started lazily - just killing time before heading off to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse
                    for
                    <em>All’s Well That Ends Well</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse is unlike any theatre I’ve been to before. The entire performance was
                    candlelit, and while I assumed that was just some modern-classical gimmick, it turned out to be as
                    literal as it sounded. As an RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) production, there were no microphones,
                    sound effects, or modern lighting - just hundreds of candles illuminating the stage and the
                    auditorium.
                    The result was a cosy, intimate atmosphere. However, there was one thing I hadn’t anticipated: it
                    was
                    boiling.
                    <br><br>
                    At first, I thought the fans being sold in the reception area were meant to make the audience feel
                    like
                    Shakespearean aristocracy. By Act III, I realised their true purpose: survival. I was practically
                    melting and spent the interval standing outside in the 5°C chill, just to cool down.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the heat, the performance was spectacular. The RSC rarely disappoints, and this was no
                    exception. They remained true to the source material while adding their own clever twists.
                    Shakespeare
                    loved a bit of cross-dressing, with men pretending to be women and vice versa, so it’s always fun to
                    see
                    directors lean into that with modern gender swaps. In this adaptation, a woman played one of the
                    male
                    characters disguised as a woman, which gave a fresh dynamic to the play. As always with Shakespeare,
                    the
                    boys got the girls, there was singing and dancing, and everything ended happily ever after. A
                    wonderful
                    afternoon at the theatre.
                    <br><br>
                    The train ride back to Darlington was uneventful but felt oddly ominous. Unlike previous years,
                    there
                    wasn’t the usual thrill of going home. No magnetic pull drawing me back. This time, I felt like I
                    should
                    have stayed in Leicester a bit longer. If I were still there I would be building the website for
                    Demon
                    magazine, producing radio shows, analysing data from the Racers’ lap-time simulations. While I’m
                    happy
                    to be home, a part of me feels like I should have postponed the trip for a few more days.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, now that I’m here, it’s time to embrace Christmas. These blogs are meant to capture my
                    day-to-day
                    life at university, the odd and wonderful things I experience in Leicester. But for now, it’s time
                    to
                    pause. Time to catch up with old friends, wrap Christmas presents, and fully enjoy the holiday
                    season.
                    See you in the new year when I have the second semester to enjoy.

                <h2>Friday, 13th December</h2>
                <p>
                    Friday the thirteenth. Today is supposed to be a day of bad luck, but after my fortunes last night,
                    I
                    think there’s only good luck left in the tank. It’s my final morning in Leicester, with little left
                    to
                    do but submit coursework and tidy my room. In the past, I’ve always had a clear idea of my predicted
                    grade for assignments, guided by realistic assumptions and some measure of confidence. This time,
                    however, feels like an outlier: the teaching was incoherent, the specifications labyrinthine, and
                    the
                    resources more contradictory than the bootstrap paradox. Love it or hate it, it’s done. I can
                    finally
                    exhale - and look forward to the season preview of <em>The Tempest</em> featuring Sigourney Weaver
                    and
                    Mathew Horne.
                    <br><br>
                    When I get around to writing my review of the play, I think my tagline will be: “A glorious
                    opportunity,
                    wasted.” For a theatre as grand as Royal Drury Lane, it didn’t make use of its opulent setting.
                    Signourney’s character, <em>Prospero</em>, is supposed to command the stage, order the audience’s
                    focus
                    by decree, unfortunately, Signourney’s interpretation of the role debased Prospero’s role down to a
                    glorified narrator. I also suspect that Signourney has had some dental work done because that would
                    explain why she turned every ‘s’ sound into a ‘th’.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><em>‘Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all
                        spirits’</em></strong> turned into <strong><em>‘Our revelth now are ended. Theth our actorths,
                    as I
                    foretold you, were all piriths’</em></strong>. It would have been funny had this been a unique
                    adaptation
                    of the Shakespeare comedy, however I don’t think this was intended.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t one of the better plays I’ve seen but that might be down to <em>The Tempest</em> being a
                    weaker script than <em>MacBeth</em> and <em>The Duchess of Malfi.</em> Nevertheless this production
                    fell
                    short of the expectations - especially when the A-list stars are expected to carry the show.

                <p>
                    I must apologise for yesterday’s ramblings. I was supposed to explicate my all-start performance on
                    the
                    Futsal court consisting of hat tricks, skills, a penalty save, even a successful rainbow flick that
                    prompted the return of the <em>‘Cole Palmer’</em> nickname. Instead a group of miscreants were
                    smoking
                    copious amounts of marajuana under my bedroom window which unlocked a slightly bemusing allegory
                    about
                    my prejudice on the abilities of the players based on their choice of footwear…
                    <br><br>
                    Onto today’s thrilling events. I had another confusing seminar with Neil that was filled with
                    contradictory advice and unusable resources, a sit-down with the careers advisor who advised me to
                    ‘pick
                    a career in <em>computering</em>’ - her words verbatim. And an admonition from UniteStudents about
                    alleged smoking in the flat. Whether they meant cigarettes or something stronger, I have no idea,
                    but I
                    suspect they’ve mistaken the aroma wafting in from the street last night as originating from inside.
                    Let’s hope I don’t return in the new year to find my belongings packed up and eviction papers on my
                    desk
                    because of someone else’s antics.
                    <br><br>
                    Marvin’s moving out today too. You know, that thirty year old bloke who was stealing my cutlery. I
                    found
                    him lugging five suitcases out to the lift. I could have helped but he stole my cutlery.
                    <br><br>
                    This means that I’m either getting a new roommate for the new year or I’m going to be in a flat with
                    only Esther and Summer. I’m fine with either scenario but if I do get another roommate then they’ll
                    likely be an exchange student or on placement seeing as there’s only six months of the academic year
                    remaining.
                    <br><br>
                    Tonight was our Hackers Christmas meal, and naturally, we gathered at our trusted haunt, Soar Point.
                    The
                    meal was nothing short of delightful - one of the best I’ve had in a long while. But if I’m honest,
                    the
                    portion size could have fed me for three meals. Ironically, while I felt overwhelmed by the sheer
                    volume, everyone else complained that the servings were too small. Determined not to waste any, I
                    pushed
                    on, trying to eat more.
                    <br><br>
                    Big mistake.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed was the most nauseating experience I’ve endured since the infamous events of November
                    15th
                    last year.
                    <br><br>
                    The mere thought of throwing up is enough to send my mind into a relentless whirlpool, what if it
                    happens in public, what if I can’t find a way to stop it, what if it hurts, what if I choke, what if
                    people see and judge me, what if it never stops, the questions spiral faster and faster until I’m
                    left
                    paralysed, my heart pounding, my breath shallow, my body bracing for a disaster that may never come
                    but
                    feels inevitable, my stomach twists as though it’s already happening, my throat tightens in
                    preemptive
                    dread, the room seems to close in, every sound feels sharper, every movement magnified, and I wonder
                    if
                    this will be the moment, the moment I lose control completely, the moment my worst fear manifests,
                    the
                    moment I’m proven right to always worry, and yet even in the midst of this storm I know I’m trapped
                    by
                    my own mind, the fear feeding on itself, growing stronger with every panicked thought, every beat of
                    my
                    racing heart, until there’s nothing left but the overwhelming certainty that escape is impossible,
                    and I
                    am entirely at its mercy.
                    <br><br>
                    To stop these spiraling thoughts, I need a distraction. An activity, a walk, something to focus my
                    mind,
                    bring me back to reality and not the maelstrom of my distorted reverie. I’m unlikely to overcome
                    this
                    fear unless faced with something entirely out of my control. Perhaps that would be for the best - a
                    forceful, inexorable event to conquer my most deep-seated fear.
                    <br><br>
                    Most people when posed with the hypothetical choice - five minutes of discomfort for a lifetime of
                    peace
                    or a lifetime of lingering unease - the choice seems obvious. Most would pick the brief discomfort
                    to
                    escape the relentless torment. Yet for me, the idea of enduring even those five minutes is
                    paralysing.
                    After eight years of building this fear into an insurmountable adversary, the prospect feels like
                    staring into an abyss.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time I’d calmed down, my desert was waiting for me though I’d already surpassed the point of
                    overindulgence. It became a waiting game - an effort to endure the aftermath and wait for this
                    episode
                    to pass.
                    <br><br>
                    A bittersweet end to my last night in Leicester for the year.

                <p>
                    I honoured my fellow futsal players with my presence this evening. It was a very discerning session.
                    I
                    can separate these people into two groups, almost as clearly as Montagues and Capulets. The
                    dichotomy is
                    telling even though each player is as distinct as the next. We arrived individually but were grouped
                    all
                    as one. We sat side by side. Lacing up. Waiting for instructions like soldiers about to go over the
                    barricades. The captains make their selections based on their own myopic biases. But I look at these
                    people through the labyrinth of my own caste. A framework of my own making. Let me show you.
                    <br><br>
                    Those who came to participate wear comfy, multi-functional trainers. Such like the ones you see in
                    shop
                    windows across the country. Trendy and modern. Bought at an inflated price tag just to accentuate
                    the
                    opulence of the purchase. Kept in a condition which says ‘I am proud to be wearing the latest
                    editions’.
                    Don’t be fooled. This is just a facade for those who are actually drowning in diffidence.
                    Highlighting
                    the imposters among the elite as obviously as a peasant assimilating the role of an aristocrat. No
                    matter how eloquent their elocution or ornate their apparel, they cannot shake their ignoble caste.
                    They
                    will soon be rooted out in game time. The menial positions are reserved for them while the artisans
                    lead
                    the line.
                    <br><br>
                    The artists among the philistines. The roses in the cauldron of thorns. These are the people who are
                    ready to play. And play to win. Not wearing any boots but in fact, astro turf boots, despite knowing
                    we
                    are playing indoors. Those who know that the extra grip on the varnished floor is the difference
                    between
                    preeminence and mediocracy. These boots have had the shine worn off them from perpetual wear and the
                    season long abuse from the owner. These boots which have scuffs and tears from leaving tackles on
                    opposing players. These boots which can tell a story of triumph and desecration. Laces which have
                    been
                    replaced and replaced again. Like a classical musician restringing his bass. The pride and joy of
                    one's
                    life. The tools to deliver the result. That is how I separate the sublime from the malign.
                    <br><br>
                    Just when I have correctly deduced the skills and capabilities of the ones who play, we have an
                    aberration. An outlier. One who chose a third root, exempting themselves from my binary bifurcation.
                    Bare foot. An unknown quantity. This is a man who chooses the difficult path regardless of the
                    consequences. Ready to face the risk with mirth and tenacity. Adroitly, masking his talents. Hiding
                    from
                    my frightful sight. Obstructing the natural order with disregard and guile. But no man is truly
                    exempt.
                    There is no room for anomalies in my game for we are artists of our craft.
                    <br><br>
                    The main event, the raison d’etre, the tapestry of time that we await to indicate the beginning of
                    our
                    meagre time together. The whistle. A pitch so high that conveys only one interpretation. And so we
                    begin.

                <p>
                    It’s make-or-break time. Everyone’s panicking because the first part of our coursework is due in
                    three
                    days. No one is entirely sure what is expected or pertinent to include. By way of reparations, my
                    lecturer has benevolently decided to give up his time to catch us up on the work he should have been
                    teaching us for the past two weeks. The only time he could manage was 6–7 pm. <em>How generous of
                    him.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, I have a Dilan. Normally, lecturers rely on him to add some much-needed context to their
                    content, but today, Dilan crossed the boundary from erudite student to teacher - informing Neil on
                    the
                    direction the module was going and what needed to be included in the assignments. Does that make me
                    a
                    teacher’s pet? What’s ironic is that Neil is the one marking the assessments, so it fills me with
                    trepidation that even he doesn’t know what’s going on. <em>“What day of the week is it Neil?”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    On a lighter note, the Xmas exchange event took place this afternoon. Twenty students studying at
                    DMU
                    rallied together for an afternoon of quizzes, Secret Santa, Pictionary and mince pies. We’re giving
                    them
                    the full British Crimbo experience. One of the quiz rounds was “Name the movie title and the year it
                    was
                    released.” I nailed every single one: <em>The Holiday</em>? Check. <em>Love Actually</em>? Come on,
                    make
                    it difficult for me. <em>It’s a Wonderful Life</em>? Do I get bonus points for naming the top-billed
                    cast, production studio, writer, and director?
                    <br><br>
                    Talking of films, I saw Red One at the cinema with Natalia and Emily this evening. It wasn’t a good
                    film, but it’s the sort of Christmas fun that puts you in the mood for the holidays. We had a good
                    natter when we got back to their flat, and because it was late and torrential rain was pouring
                    outside,
                    I crashed on their sofa. Surprisingly comfy. It’s good to know I’ve got somewhere I’m welcome to
                    stay if
                    I ever get locked out.

                    No one enjoys job hunting. It’s tedious but necessary. Whether it’s internships, graduate positions,
                    or
                    work experience, the application process demands the same level of effort: tailoring CVs,
                    researching
                    companies, and convincing them that working for them would, without question, be the single greatest
                    achievement you could hope for all while maintaining an air of professionalism and gravitas.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. Casting a wide net across various positions doesn’t
                    necessarily
                    improve the odds of success either. The job market is a cruel mistress.
                    <br><br>
                    I had been expecting an email from East Midlands Chamber confirming an interview for a summer
                    internship. When I followed up this week, I discovered that the university’s careers team hadn’t
                    forwarded my details, and the position had already been filled. This process is hard enough without
                    my
                    university dropping the ball too!

                <p>
                    At the start of this weekend, I had ambitious plans: spend a productive few days catching up on the
                    material we were supposed to have covered in seminars and begin dissecting the first part of the
                    coursework due Friday. Unfortunately, none of this has come to fruition.
                    <br><br>
                    Normally, I’m well-organised, with academic responsibilities firmly prioritised over social
                    activities.
                    But this coursework is proving confusing and utterly perplexing, largely because we haven’t been
                    taught
                    any of the content. I might as well be sitting a medical exam - I know as much about appendectomies
                    as I
                    do about software methodology strategies. Thanks to our lecturer’s blunders, we’ve been left in a
                    precarious imbroglio, along with the department. It’ll be interesting to see how they plan to fix
                    this
                    mess. I’m hoping for a deadline extension or at least some extra support, though I suspect that’s
                    optimistic.
                    <br><br>
                    When faced with an academic impasse, I have a tradition: hit Soar Point, the hub of all
                    student-related
                    fun and society business. It also helps that the last race of the 2024 calendar was on, which meant
                    a
                    great turnout from the lads. Vivisect was there, the visible red mark on his cheek serving as a
                    reminder
                    of last night’s antics. He kept shooting me unforgiving looks, though every time Veronika and I
                    exchanged glances, we couldn’t help but giggle.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, everyone made it home safely after last night’s chaos. Michael looked a little worse for
                    wear after his dance-floor dispute, but credit where it’s due - he stood his ground, even on
                    something
                    as inconsequential as debating the greatest F1 drivers of all time.
                    <br><br>
                    The race itself was a spectacle, capped off with a touching homage to Lewis Hamilton. There was
                    plenty
                    of grimacing after Verstappen took out Piastri on the first lap, but all was forgiven as McLaren
                    hoisted
                    the constructors' championship trophy.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the football was on afterward, I ended up spending the entire afternoon and evening at the
                    pub. So
                    much for having a productive weekend.

                    Oh, what a day! The DMURacers had scheduled an impromptu Christmas session, as many of the lads are
                    leaving next Friday to go back home, making this weekend the last opportunity for a gathering. I
                    don’t
                    drink, but I still succumbed to peer pressure from the lads and joined them. It’s not my usual
                    social
                    scene, but in my quest to become the social butterfly I so desperately aspire to be, I followed the
                    phalanx of racers to the train station. Where were we going? We didn’t know until we saw the boards.
                    I
                    told you it was impromptu.
                    <br><br>
                    Destination: Stamford. Not anywhere near Stamford Bridge or even anywhere in that general direction
                    but
                    a town east of Leicester.
                    <br><br>
                    “It has a Waitrose, Homebase and a football stadium so it’s bound to have a good selection of
                    boozers.”
                    <br><br>
                    Leaving a full three minutes till the train came, we finalised our decision and rushed to the
                    machines
                    to purchase our tickets.
                    <br><br>
                    There were around 15 of us on this expedition to Stamford, but let me introduce you to the key
                    players
                    in this anecdote: Curtis, the team technician; James, the team leader; Michael, Midlands go-karting
                    champion; Dani, F1 statistician; Vivisect (nicknamed because he once owned a cat that he - well,
                    never
                    mind); Veronika, aspiring lesbian after watching the Lionesses at the Euros; and Dan, alcoholic.
                    <br><br>
                    What did I bring to this talented group? I was the peacekeeper, thanks to my sobriety and my
                    tendency to
                    diffuse heated situations.
                    <br><br>
                    The first few pubs were uneventful - food, darts, drinks, and even a pub quiz at our third stop. All
                    fun
                    and games. James and Curtis, being of a similar age, carried themselves like old men at the pub:
                    convivial, treating everyone like old friends. It’s an unspoken language one learns through years of
                    drinking in pubs. Michael regaled us with his latest victory on the circuit, while Dan and Vivisect
                    unsuccessfully tried to flirt with the locals. Everyone’s ears perked up, however, when we reached
                    the
                    F1 round of the quiz. F1 is to the racers, what Doctor Who is to the Hackers. It’s great to see such
                    passion bringing people together.
                    <br><br>
                    As it got later, the clubs started opening. As Team Leader, James had unilateral control over the
                    itinerary. Marching with a purposeful gait and google maps open, we landed in club #1. For the
                    record,
                    clubbing is not my scene. I don’t like loud music, I don’t like shouting, I don’t like drinking, I
                    don’t
                    like the sticky floors, and I don’t like the smell of wet dog and stale alcohol permeating the air.
                    <em>Get
                        me back home where I’ll be in bed with a good book and lights out at a reasonable hour.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Despite my grievances, I do like to dance. I have rhythm and enough moves in my repertoire to make
                    Frank
                    Sinatra smile. Plus, it was amusing to observe our band of misfits in their attempts to impress the
                    locals. Do chat-up lines still work? Did they ever? That didn’t stop Dan and Vivisect from trying.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Are you a magician? Because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears.”</strong>
                    Lighthearted, flattering without being over the top. Solid 7/10.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk past again?”</strong> Cheeky and
                    fun
                    but old and overused. 4/10.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>“Lucky for you, I’m pissed so you’ve gone from a 3 to an 8. Let’s go into the
                        disables?"</strong>(Vivisect still has that red mark across his face when I’m writing this up
                    two
                    days later.)
                    <br><br>
                    Michael and Veronica were spectating too but they were far more interested in the day’s F1 events
                    than
                    to participate in this modern ritual. Especially seeing what can happen if it goes wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    Later that evening in the same club, much to our surprise, Vivisect and Dan were actually
                    entertaining
                    female company at the table down from us. Eavesdropping surreptitiously, we struggled to suppress
                    our
                    laughter. It was like watching a penguin try to salsa dance - awkward, yet mesmerising in its
                    chaotic,
                    flipper-flapping way.
                    <br><br>
                    James and Curtis herded us all to the next club. I got to see a few of the sights in this pretty
                    little
                    town. Less pretty now after some of the boys had left their mark but nonetheless, it had the
                    ethereal
                    tranquility of the village from <em>Hot Fuzz</em>. We soldiered on, accompanied by Dan and
                    Vivisect’s
                    dalliances. A certain lexicon emerges on nights out - words I hadn’t heard since my drinking days at
                    West Park when I was fifteen. “Mortalled.” “Peeved.” “Curved.” What does “curved” mean in this
                    context?
                    Intoxicated? Regretful? Subtext for “I’m going to go home and rethink my life”? Probably not.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t until we reached the second club that everything went arse over tit. I was standing around
                    a
                    table with Dani, James, and Curtis - we were the ‘supervisors’ among these children. Dani is
                    perpetually
                    broke but has an uncanny talent for <em>utilising her assets</em>, as she puts it, to score free
                    drinks.
                    I’ve seen her skills in action, and they could genuinely be a case study in psychology. It’s
                    frightening
                    how easily she can manipulate men, even for something as trivial as the chance of a dance later on.
                    The
                    strategic hair flick helps, too. It’s not quite as iconic as Gilda’s, but it’s certainly effective.
                    Men
                    are so simple... apparently.
                    <br><br>
                    Dan and Vivisect had joined us at the table with their dates - persisting with their brazen
                    coquetry.
                    Meanwhile, Michael managed to upset someone on the dance floor. I later learned that it all started
                    as a
                    debate about the greatest F1 driver of all time - an unusual topic for a nightclub conversation with
                    strangers. But you must understand, this is all Michael talks about: cars, karting, and F1. Michael
                    argued for Hamilton, while the other guy - a bloke who looked about forty - stood firm on Senna.
                    What
                    began as a harmless discussion quickly escalated into a full-blown altercation. Though I was there
                    in my
                    quasi-role as peacekeeper, I knew better than to intervene once this guy started throwing his weight
                    around.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as we see the commotion on the dance floor, James and Curtis rush in like the protective older
                    brothers. They are solid so I had no doubt that they would be able to handle the situation. Dan and
                    Vivisect, however; I think a strong wind would blow them over - especially after the copious
                    quantities
                    of alcohol they’d consumed.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe it was just to look heroic in front of their dates, a burst of Dutch courage, or plain old
                    drunken
                    indecision. Either way, Dan and Vivisect charged into the fray, leaving Veronika and me at the table
                    to
                    enjoy the unexpected aftermath of their efforts. As the chaos unfolded, Veronika struck up a
                    conversation with the girl Dan had been unsuccessfully courting all night. It turned out the girl
                    wasn’t
                    the <em>straight</em> shooter as we had all thought - or maybe she was just after free drinks.
                    Either
                    way, Veronika ended up kissing her, which seemed to confirm her suspicions about herself. She was no
                    longer just <em>aspiring</em> - her newfound confidence earned her a round of celebratory
                    congratulations, so felicitations to her.
                    <br><br>
                    For my part, Jessica, who had been with Vivisect all evening, decided she preferred someone sober
                    and
                    unmarked to Vivisect’s alcohol-soaked charms and the giant red slap mark on his face. I was in the
                    right
                    place, right time; and certainly not complaining. While Dan and Vivisect played the part of gallant
                    (if
                    misguided) knights, Veronika and I reaped the rewards of their valiant missteps. Heroes come in all
                    forms, and on this night, we were the ones to answer the call. I guess I am a lover; not a fighter
                    afterall.
                    <br><br>
                    With the equivalent of a <em>Ballroom Biltz</em> erupting in the club, the chaos of the night
                    culminated
                    in all of us being escorted out by bouncers. The commotion probably made their night, given the
                    usual
                    tranquility of this quaint town. With the last train to Leicester about to leave, it was a fitting
                    end
                    to our Christmas bash. Dan and Vivisect were understandably incensed at our triumphs, but it didn’t
                    bother us. We were drunk on stolen glory and the absurdity of the night - a kind of intoxication no
                    liquor could replicate.
                    <br><br>
                    So, my first Christmas social: darts, quizzes, dancing, fighting, triumphs, regrets, and unrequited
                    victories. A strong start to the festive season. Here’s hoping the Hackers’ Christmas meal follows a
                    similar path.

                <p>
                    Software Methods and Standards - the only thing that I’ve been ranting on about on a daily basis -
                    has
                    taken a severe turn for the worst. We have our first deadline a week from today and our lecturer has
                    taken this opportunity to inform us that he’s been teaching us the material scheduled for the new
                    year.
                    I wish I could vindicate him by saying that’s why the course has felt so disjointed but I think
                    that’s
                    just his pedagogy style. To aid us in catching up, he has generously given up his time next week, to
                    cover the scheduled seminars. At this point, I want all the material to be released online because
                    I’m
                    sure Google will be more informative and coherent than this lecturer.
                    <br><br>
                    Friday night is my night producing in the Radio studio. I’ve mentioned previously how I’ve become a
                    steady hand in producing, gaining the trust of my presenters, so now I’ve been offered another night
                    in
                    addition to my current slot to further hone my skills. I’ve decided to postpone this decision till
                    the
                    new year since I’ll be leaving this time next week so it’s hardly the time to be making new
                    commitments.
                    <br><br>
                    From the interest garnered from the freshers events in October and November, it sounds like there
                    are
                    going to be a number of new shows in 2025 so I will be more than happy to just ship to produce any
                    of
                    those. It has started to become a little irksome, hearing my presenters repeat the same phrases
                    after
                    each song. ‘I just love that song’. ‘It really speaks to me’. ‘This is what I love about radio,
                    sharing
                    new songs with you all’.
                    <br><br>
                    If I need to do another six months with these two, I might just go <em>radio gaga.</em>

                    The coursework has been released for the module and I’m still unclear about what the purpose of the
                    module is. It’s not looking good. The first deadline is next Friday when the semester ends. The
                    second
                    and third deadline is the end of the module at the end of January. A positive to derive from the
                    situation is, I have plenty of time to do googling and researching because these lecturers are just
                    making an already confusing module incomprehensible. I wonder how others are fairing. I know Dillan
                    is
                    in the same position as I am so it’s not just me not being a dullard.

                    proofread any other articles but my own. Now that I’ve vindicated myself for the errors permeating

                <h2>Wednesday, 4th December</h2>
                <p>
                    The time is upon us! The official first edition of the Demon magazine under the new editor-in-chief
                    is
                    here: Issue 53. I’ve seen the online copy and had some concerns. Unfortunately, seeing the printed
                    version only confirmed them. The margins cut off the start of some paragraphs, and the designers
                    turned
                    some pieces from magazine articles into what look like leaflets. (You’ll see what I mean when I link
                    it.) Thankfully, my pages look respectable, so that’s all I’m focusing on. It’s a bit embarrassing
                    for
                    the current editors, who proofread these articles only to leave egregious mistakes, but that’s their
                    problem—not mine.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, the first meeting for the Paris trip happened this evening. The fifteen or so people
                    who
                    showed up were very easy to get along with and shared some interesting stories about their
                    motivations
                    for going. Some were equivocal, following the careers team’s lead by citing the terrific
                    opportunities
                    this trip could offer and the industry connections we could make. Others were more straightforward
                    and
                    mentioned their desire to see the Eiffel Tower. My answer was a subtle mix of both.
                    <br><br>
                    Since it was just a meet-and-greet, we played a few games, participated in quizzes about Paris, and
                    did
                    some team-building exercises. We also went over the itinerary, which I think is perfect. We’ll
                    depart
                    from London St Pancras at half past three, arriving in Paris at 7 p.m. On Tuesday, we have an
                    introduction and tasks led by Tanium, the cybersecurity company. Wednesday and Thursday are free
                    days,
                    with only an alumni dinner planned with former De Montfort students now living in Paris. This gives
                    me
                    plenty of time to see the sights: The Louvre, Versailles, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,
                    Jardin
                    des Tuileries, and even enjoy a cruise down the Seine River. If I have time, I’d love to catch a
                    production of <em>Les Misérables</em>. Even if it’s in its native language, it would certainly be an
                    unforgettable experience.

                <h2>Tuesday, 3rd December</h2>
                <p>
                    The BBC open call deadline closed at midday today, and I’m relieved to have submitted my pilot
                    manuscript over the weekend. Scriptwriting is a completely new skill for me, so I was learning on
                    the
                    fly to ensure it met industry standards. Honestly, I find it less stressful than novel
                    writing—there’s
                    no need to obsess over intricate descriptions of surroundings. Just dialogue, a few stage
                    directions,
                    and done. There’s no word on the website about when feedback will be provided, probably because it
                    depends on when they finish reviewing submissions. I’m not desperate for this to lead to a job, but
                    I’m
                    definitely eager to get some constructive feedback on my work.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon should have been dedicated to three hours of Software Methods and Standards, a
                    session
                    that usually feels like a marathon. But today was different. When I arrived, the Hawthorne
                    building—home
                    to the Health and Science labs—was locked, and all the students were gathered on the grass outside.
                    Speculation was rife: a chemical leak? Poison gas? An Ebola outbreak? Nobody had any answers, but
                    the
                    gossip alone almost made the trip worthwhile.
                    <br><br>
                    Under normal circumstances, I’d celebrate an unexpected free afternoon. I’d head home, put on a
                    film,
                    maybe get some writing done, or tinker with my website. But missing this session actually frustrated
                    me.
                    I’m already grappling with the purpose of this module, and skipping lectures and seminars isn’t
                    helping
                    to clarify things. Still, there wasn’t much to do but head home.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve nearly finished my writing portfolio, though I still need to rework my website's style. The
                    feedback I’ve received so far keeps pointing out its uncanny resemblance to the BBC site, so that’s
                    something to tackle over the holidays. With the Christmas break starting in a week and a half, it’ll
                    keep me busy and productive. I’ve also got to squeeze in Christmas shopping for my Leicester friends
                    before next Friday, so the next few days are shaping up to be full-on.

                <h2>Monday, 2nd December</h2>
                <p>I got my first glimpse of the magazine today, and overall, it looks professional. It’s sleek and
                    well-designed on many pages. However, it’s clear the designers weren’t informed about the page
                    margins,
                    which will result in some content being cut off during printing. As a result, some pages will appear
                    disjointed due to text being lost in the process. While the online version will be fine, that
                    doesn’t
                    excuse the chief designers for not properly briefing their team.
                    <br><br>
                    The magazine is thirty-two pages long, featuring around eighteen articles—a solid achievement,
                    especially since previous editions only reached a total of eighteen pages. I met with Jess, the
                    editor-in-chief, to discuss the website (which is outdated and visibly in need of a refresh). During
                    our
                    meeting, she also brought up several issues with the magazine that go beyond design. It turns out
                    the
                    section editors are either careless proofreaders or dyslexic—perhaps both. Regardless, they
                    shouldn’t
                    have volunteered for the job if they weren’t confident in their skills. There were spelling
                    mistakes,
                    grammatical errors, and even a random sentence in the middle of one page where the editor had
                    forgotten
                    to copy the entire text into the final draft. Fortunately, my sections were written and edited by
                    me, so
                    they were error-free. As a result, Jess has asked me to take on the role of Health and Lifestyle
                    editor,
                    thanks to my meticulous eye for detail—and, of course, my lack of dyslexia.
                    <br><br>
                    Jess and her friends are studying journalism, so this is their area of expertise. For me, this is
                    just
                    another opportunity to branch out beyond my Computer Science degree. Apparently, all journalism
                    students
                    are encouraged to start blog websites in their first year, so Jess and I took the chance to exchange
                    and
                    critique each other's work. Jess is an impressive writer for someone who dislikes reading. It still
                    confounds me that many aspiring journalists are so averse to reading books, biographies, or even the
                    news, despite it being a core part of their profession. Nevertheless, Jess clearly falls into that
                    small
                    percentage of people who possess a natural talent for writing.

                <h2>Sunday, 1st December</h2>
                <p><em>It's Christmas! </em>Officially and unequivocally. Dust off that Mariah Carey EP, get Love
                    Actually
                    on, make sure to have a bucket of water balloons next to the door in case the carol singers come
                    calling. Oh, what a wonderful time of the year. Leicester is buzzing with the Christmas spirit. The
                    Christmas lights got switched on in town last week (in November, I know!) and the Tree’s already
                    been
                    decorated and lit up under the town clock. As for me, it’s hard to get into the Christmas spirit
                    when
                    I’m expecting a fair amount of work to be dropped on me in the coming days. However, for today, it’s
                    a
                    glorious day of football and F1. No pending deadlines as of yet and no responsibilities for the
                    Radio
                    station or the magazine. Life is good.

                <p>
                    I got complimented on my style today. From a fashion student too so that lends some credence to
                    their
                    opinions do you think?
                    <br><br>
                    I was in the pub for the majority of the day. First watching the Boro dispatch Hull and then the
                    three
                    o’clock kickoffs followed by the Formula One qualifying. I was bouncing between three groups of
                    friends
                    all afternoon. Mehmet and his Turkish friends all have a strong predilection for Arsenal for some
                    reason
                    so they were in jovial spirits when Arsenal scored their fourth. A little bit of trepidation crept
                    into
                    their voices when West Ham decided to stage a daring comeback but the overall result remained firmly
                    in
                    Arsenal’s favour.
                    <br><br>
                    The F1 qualifying was disappointing with Verstappen taking pole. Out of the twenty DMU Racers that
                    turned up to the pub, not one supported Red Bull. More than half are Mercedes or McLaren fans. We’ve
                    got
                    some French students supporting Alpine, a few Germans supporting Sauber and one Italian cheering for
                    Ferrari. But not one Red Bull supporter in the house. The season is all but over with only the
                    constructors title still left to compete for but the general apathy is starting to take hold. We
                    headed
                    over to the pool tables, where I managed to win a few free drinks off the lads - naturally, my
                    snooker
                    endowments came in handy. It’s a shame I don’t drink so instead I just took their cash. Always a
                    pleasure, lads.

                <p>
                    After a long day yesterday, I was in for an even longer day today. The new module - Software
                    Development
                    Methods & Standards - is as byzantine as it sounds. Each teacher has a different pedology style
                    which
                    makes the overall structure of the course unnecessarily complex. It would be a prodigious help if we
                    were given clear instructions on the assessment from an early stage instead of keeping us in the
                    dark
                    until they find it prudent to spring it on us. The schedule has us attending one lecture a week and
                    three two-hour seminars. This is problematic in itself because seminars are not recorded, nor are
                    the
                    powerpoints uploaded for further revision (because most of the time it’s just a discussion and not
                    anything worth creating a presentation for).
                    <br><br>
                    A module that solely relies on students attending petrifies me because how are we supposed to revise
                    for
                    the inevitable phase test at the end. Are we going to be quizzed on questions that we’ve spoken
                    about in
                    the seminars or is the module leader going to ask us to do a presentation of our own? I’m at the end
                    of
                    the first week out of seven and this module is proving to be more enigmatic than a <em>Sherlock
                    Holmes</em> tale.
                    <br><br>
                    I did my radio slot producing another banger of a show; further developing my nascent knowledge of
                    the
                    broadcasting world. It may be superficial based on my projected career path but it brings me great
                    pleasure sitting in that booth controlling the station with only myself responsible each week. Also,
                    I
                    found out why Ghost has given herself/himself that particular nickname. She/he was oddly overt with
                    sharing it. When she/he committed suicide in 2019, she/he thought she/he saw herself/himself as an
                    apparition. It may have been an outer body experience or just a deluge of chemicals flooding the
                    brain
                    but she/he was adamant in her/his belief. Since then she/he is now living vicariously through this
                    ethereal spirit. I wonder if she/he saw herself/himself as the opposite gender which is why
                    referring to
                    her/him now takes twice as long. Nevertheless, this is the fourth person to openly express their
                    suicidal tendencies to the group.
                    <br><br>
                    The Health and Wellbeing role in each society is normally a nominal position; there to satisfy the
                    universities inclusion and acceptance policies but in Demon Media, it should be a full-time
                    position.

                <h2>Thursday, 28th November</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m off to London. Again. And similar to last time I am up and down in a day. Just a brief sojourn
                    to
                    break up the monotony of coding and writing. So what was the purpose this time? Well I’m seeing a
                    play.
                    <em>The play’s the thing.</em> But surprisingly it’s not Shakespeare on this occasion. <em>The
                    Duchess</em> starring Jodie Whittaker has been on my wishlist for some time and with the current run
                    coming to an end next month, I needed to schedule an impromptu trip to see it.
                    <br><br>
                    I had no preconceived notions since I hadn’t read it but my English Literature friends hold it in
                    high
                    regard. I thought I had a good grasp of things after the first half. A comedic love story similar to
                    that of Romeo and Juliet. The Duchess is recalcitrant of her brothers so she chooses to marry one of
                    her
                    stewards shortly after becoming a widow. Once the brothers find out, the Steward has to flee with
                    their
                    two young children. After the intermission, I think John Webster had too much hopped beer. Torture,
                    murder, perfidy. A rapid change of tone compared to the light-hearted merriment of the first half.
                    Heart
                    wrenching throughout but unnecessarily graphic at certain points. Seeing the projection of the
                    Duchess’
                    husband and son being shot repeatedly on a loop on the white backdrop of the stage was more like
                    torture
                    for the audience instead of for the Duchess.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I was impressed with the play. It was good but I couldn’t help but feel that it could have
                    been
                    great had it not been for the modern revisions to adapt it from the original. The random musical
                    interludes by a spectre dressed in white, (I assume she was supposed to depict an angel watching
                    over
                    the Duchess after she was murdered), slowed the pace down monumentally. The comedy aspects could be
                    removed too as it’s supposed to be a grievous revenge tragedy. The dialogue with the English
                    Literature
                    students behind me agreed with this notion seeing they weren’t overly impressed with the modern
                    revisions. Mainly the superfluous swearing. It had a contrary effect rather than the intense
                    earnestness
                    that was intended.
                    <br><br>
                    After <em>The Duchess</em>, I headed over to the Apollo Theatre for <em>Fawlty Towers - The
                    Play</em>.
                    Again, I didn’t do any research into the play but as I’d seen the TV show, I figured it would be a
                    continuation of the story with Basil, Cybil and Polly. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed. It
                    was
                    just a round-up of the greatest hits. It was a two hour performance and in the first five minutes
                    we’ve
                    been told to expect the hotel inspectors, Cybils ingrown toenail, the Germans and that pesky moose.
                    Expectedly, Mrs Richardson made an appearance along with a poor facsimile of Bernnie Cribbins’ Mr
                    Hutchinson character.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m sure it’s a fan favourite and the audience were laughing at the jokes but I was contemplating
                    leaving at the interval. I knew what was coming up and many of the scenes were rushed in order to
                    cram
                    in as many storylines as possible. It was a great rendition of the Basil Fawlty character,
                    culminating
                    with the hilarious sketch with the Germans, but ultimately, I feel like this was an evening wasted.
                    I
                    would have been much better suited watching <em>The Mousetrap</em>. Even if it is just my own
                    expectations that have let me down on this occasion.

                <p>
                    It’s only taken me eleven months since becoming receptive to new films, but I’ve finally sat down to
                    watch <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. About an hour in, I thought I might have
                    misinterpreted
                    its primary themes because it could almost be categorised as a comedy. McMurphy organising a
                    basketball
                    game with the Chief, standing under the net to block free throws, and casually walking up the court
                    to
                    score points felt almost whimsical. Then there’s the scene of chartering the fishing boat with
                    eleven -
                    <em>err, doctors</em> - after stealing the school bus.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t until the final act that the darker realities of life in a mental hospital took center
                    stage.
                    Electric shock therapy is always depicted as a draconian measure, often portrayed as the stuff of
                    nightmares. McMurphy’s character doesn’t seem to change after the first round, but the second leaves
                    him
                    incapacitated. I also suspected Billy would commit suicide, though I anticipated it happening at a
                    different point in the film.
                    <br><br>
                    If I were to do an analytical study on the reasons behind Billy’s actions, I’d arraign Nurse Ratched
                    as
                    the cause. Her deep infatuation with power over her patients overwhelmed her duty to help them.
                    Despite
                    McMurphy’s tragic end, there’s a poetic symmetry in the Chief using McMurphy’s escape plan for his
                    own
                    bid for freedom. Solid 9.5/10. Now, I just need to watch <em>The Shining</em> to complete the Jack
                    Nicholson trifecta from the New Hollywood era. Who would have thought I’d end up watching a French
                    film
                    before <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>?

                    Who hovers at 3am?! Is this some sort of nervous tick or a coping mechanism? Whatever it is, can it
                    be
                    postponed till first light?
                    <br><br>
                    I got my mark back from the case analysis that I submitted almost a month ago. 90%. Good I’m a good
                    writer. My skill with the quill is undeniable, and my lectures just can’t get enough of my
                    ostentatious
                    lexicon. I’ve evidently chosen the wrong course because I still can’t code for toffee.
                    <br><br>
                    It was the start of my next module as well today. It is similar to the Agile Development module I
                    took
                    in second year because when the course has been ‘reimagined’, (as the faculty put it), anyone who
                    went
                    on a placement or on an Erasmus exchange is now being penalised and stymied. There are topics which
                    I
                    won’t cover and multiple subjects which I will be repeating. Not ideal in terms of learning but it
                    does
                    aid me in my journey for that first.

                    I swifty headed to the radio studios to sort out the show for Friday night. Jamie’s very
                    laissez-faire,
                    meaning that he allows me to sort the running order and the timings out. After two years of
                    producing
                    his own <em>New Music Medley</em> show on Friday nights, I think he’s appreciative of my assistance
                    in
                    the studio.

                <h2>Monday, 25th November</h2>
                <p>
                    I watched a foreign film today. <em>Belle de Jour</em>. As you might have guessed, it’s French. But
                    honestly, I think I would have found it just as confusing if it was in English. It’s about a woman
                    who’s
                    unfulfilled in her marriage and has a penchant for sadomasochism. To satisfy her fantasies, she
                    spends
                    her afternoons in a brothel which she enjoys but her secret is exposed when one of her clients is
                    friends with her husband. What confused me about the film was trying to discern what was real and
                    what
                    was a dream. The first scene shows Belle getting carried off into the woods where she is whipped
                    after
                    her husband finds out about her infidelity. This would make sense to the story but is inconsistent
                    with
                    the ending (which was also premature! I was expecting another ten minutes to complete the
                    denouement.)
                    The ending has Belle’s husband convalescing from being shot by an infatuated client but then in the
                    same
                    scene, the paralysed husband gets up and hugs Belle. AND THEN IT ENDS.
                    <br><br>
                    EXPLAIN IT.
                    <br><br>
                    PLEASE.
                    <br><br>
                    It is still a good film but what could have made it better was the clear distinction of what was
                    real
                    and what was fictitious. There weren’t any clever camera angles or incorporeal jingles which told us
                    when Belle was in a reverie so it’s up to the audience to figure it out. Reading up on the film,
                    this is
                    the director’s modus operandi which is why his is so revered in the surrealist film genre. My brain
                    hurts. Perhaps, I better stick to <em>Film Noir</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    After banging my head against a wall several times, trying to decipher the film, I headed to the
                    radio
                    station to do a four hour stint, producing. It wasn’t supposed to be double-bubble but after I did
                    the
                    first two hour slot with Jamie, I was beseeched by the Station Manager to produce the next show
                    because
                    the host was struggling with the dual-roles of presenter and producer. I have to say I agree with
                    Angel’s opinion because Lantern, yes that’s really her name, (his name?) kept pressing the wrong
                    buttons
                    and erroneously assuming her mic was off when it wasn’t. The nadir of her show was when she/he/they
                    swore twice and accidentally turned the sound mixer off resulting in dead-air for thirty seconds.
                    And
                    that was all in the first five minutes. <em>Amateur</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Just to top this off, she/he/they also has crippling anxiety therefore proceeded to have a panic
                    attack
                    whilst I’m trying to sort the mixing desk out. I think the Station manager foresaw this which is why
                    she
                    disappeared as soon as I stepped back into the studio. For those who were listening, they were
                    probably
                    wondering why a series of tracks from <em>The Jam, Madness</em> and <em>The Killers</em> filled the
                    airways during a Musical Medley show. Really, I could do a show without a presenter and just play
                    consecutive songs for an hour. It’ll give me valuable time to play with the technology and gain a
                    little
                    more experience. Unfortunately the software we use is only available in the studios so we can’t
                    prepare
                    shows on our laptops. I’ve spoken to Ian who is the Radio station technician and he agrees with my
                    inference that is more annoying than it is practical but he can’t do anything to address this. I
                    suggested virtualisation or using VMs, (surprisingly, he knew what these terms meant without me
                    explaining them) but he stopped me in my tracks. He explained the limitations that have plagued the
                    student Radio station for years and touched on the infinitesimal resources he was operating with. I
                    think his explanation was more meretricious than forthright; giving a bit of flim-flam to stop me
                    from
                    asking more questions. Either way, it just gives me an excuse to spend more time in the studio
                    rather
                    than on my own.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, Mother made me send her back my Christmas money, probably because of all the talk about
                    MacBooks
                    on Saturday. I imagine she thinks I’m profligate and going to waste my money on something like that…

                <p>
                    The Las Vegas Grand Prix kicked off at 6 a.m. UK time, which meant setting my alarm for the ungodly
                    hour
                    of 5:30am. Why? To catch Martin Brundle’s iconic grid walk, of course. Predictably, anyone with even
                    a
                    whiff of fame descended on the event, desperate to attach their names to this glittering spectacle.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me be clear: I’m still not a fan of this race being on the F1 calendar. The U.S. already boasts
                    races in Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. Meanwhile, countries like those in Africa are
                    campaigning
                    for their shot at hosting a Grand Prix, only to be sidelined in favour of Vegas’s flashy appeal. In
                    any
                    other GP weekend, the race itself is the main event. But here in Las Vegas? It feels more like an
                    accessory to the pomp and pageantry.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Rant over.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    On to the race: George Russell dominated from start to finish, with Lewis Hamilton close behind,
                    making
                    it a stellar weekend for Mercedes and British fans. But, as expected, Max Verstappen clinched the
                    Drivers' Championship, which, let’s be honest, was always a foregone conclusion. Still, Verstappen’s
                    triumph somewhat dims the glow of what was otherwise a fantastic result for the Britons.
                    <br><br>
                    The race wrapped up by 7:45am. I was out running by 8am. Finished eating my eggs for breakfast by 9.
                    Then found myself bored with nothing left to do until Super Sunday rolled around.

                <p>
                    I find myself in desperate need of a new laptop - though "new" doesn't quite capture the full scope
                    of
                    what I'm after. No, I need an upgrade. The truth is, I go through laptops with the same recklessness
                    as
                    Henry Fonda did marriages. Three laptops in three years at university - each succumbing to some form
                    of
                    untimely demise, and all entirely beyond my control. One, tragically, met its end when it was
                    inadvertently sat upon by a Swedish commuter on the metro. But I digress.
                    <br><br>
                    As I approach the more demanding stages of my degree, my laptop has become the critical tool for
                    running
                    heavy-duty software: web servers, virtual machines, Android emulators. These resource-intensive
                    applications tax my system’s capabilities to their limit, causing frequent crashes, draining battery
                    life, and putting my laptop through a ceaseless grind.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve always avoided MacBooks, primarily due to their inflated price tags. After all, the same specs
                    on a
                    Lenovo can be found for a good £400 less than the equivalent MacBook. That said, I can no longer
                    ignore
                    the reality: Macs are built to run exactly the type of resource-hungry programs I use on a daily
                    basis,
                    making them far more efficient than my current setup. Beyond that, having a Mac would eliminate the
                    frustration of juggling between operating systems. I currently run both Windows and Linux to
                    accommodate
                    different software needs, which forces me into a constant, time-consuming switch. Take, for example,
                    the
                    Adobe Suite that I use for audio editing and Photoshop that are only supported by Windows.
                    Conversely, I
                    prefer Linux because coding is infinitely more manageable, thanks to its seamless access to the
                    terminal.
                    <br><br>
                    MacBooks, in contrast, strike the balance of compatibility across all these applications, as they’re
                    widely used and universally supported. But here’s the catch: despite all their merits, there is
                    simply
                    no way I’m justifying a £1500 laptop purchase when I’m down to only six months left at university. I
                    should have invested in one three years ago instead of buying the gaming laptop which I subsequently
                    sold…

                <p>
                    Last week, I suspected my flatmates of being thieves. Today, I uncovered the truth. It wasn't the
                    teenagers, Esther or Summer - no, the culprit is Marvin, the 30-year-old man. He's the one who’s
                    been
                    taking my cutlery. If you want to use them, fine - let’s share. Use it, wash it, and put it back,
                    simple. But let’s not start taking each other’s things and claiming them as our own, stashing them
                    in
                    our own cupboards. I did ask him about it, and instead of denying it, his response was so baffling
                    that
                    I can only describe it as resembling the behaviour of someone with dementia - he seemed to have no
                    recollection of ever using any cutlery whatsoever. <em>Sigh</em>. I suppose this is the game we’re
                    playing now. I really don’t want to start storing kitchen utensils in my room but that might be the
                    only
                    thing left to do if this thievery persists, especially after I’ve confronted him.
                    <br><br>
                    A quick update: You remember the review I wrote for Dalia, reflecting on my year in Stockholm? Well,
                    one
                    of the three questions I answered has now been published. To recap, the task was to provide advice
                    we
                    wish we had received before, during, and after our Erasmus year. My section, which focused on advice
                    for
                    the pre-Erasmus phase, has been published - but not without considerable censorship, which I
                    strongly
                    suspect was carried out by Dalia herself.
                    <br><br>
                    There is not a single issue mentioned - no culture shock, no visa delays, no difficulties of any
                    kind.
                    The reviews paint an entirely unrealistic picture, suggesting that Erasmus students simply choose
                    their
                    destination, board a plane, are met with open arms, make an abundance of new friends, accumulate
                    boundless experience, and leave with perfect exam scores, longing for another year abroad. This is
                    not
                    an embellishment; it is outright mendacity.
                    <br><br>
                    Had Dalia desired only uncritical, positive feedback, she should have made that explicit from the
                    outset. Instead, she used the ‘tailor it to your own experience’ spiel knowing unequivocally that
                    not
                    everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows. It just feels somewhat deceptive, especially given
                    that all the reviews follow the same script now. Overt advertisements for the Erasmus program
                    instead of
                    genuine, nuanced reflections from the participants.

                    I slept in this morning; something I’ve not been able to do in the two months since I moved in due
                    to
                    the uncooperative spring placement which sticks me in the side when I roll over. However yesterday,
                    after a flip and a twist, all is well again. It’s not the first time it’s been flipped as evidenced
                    by
                    the stain in one corner, nevertheless, it clearly is more comfortable after the ten hours of
                    uninterrupted sleep I’ve had.
                    <br><br>
                    It is the fourth day of the holidays and I have not been as productive as I would have liked, though
                    not
                    for lack of trying. I’ve been sociable and I have been coding but I haven’t achieved the projects
                    which
                    I noted on my to-do list last weekend. Debugging, as always, is a Sisyphean task: hours of work,
                    oceans
                    of frustration, and at the end of it all, my boulder is right back at the bottom of the hill. <em>(Thank
                    you Stephen Fry for the lessons in Greek Mythology).</em>
                    <br><br>
                    In dire need of a break, I caught up with Natalia at her flat this afternoon. Not Polish Natalia -
                    well,
                    yes, Polish Natalia, but not <em>that</em> Polish Natalia. Not the one teaching me photography -
                    this is
                    Natalia who I’ve known the longest who’s a researcher. Natalia who knows campus gossip like the back
                    of
                    her hand. You’d think graduating would loosen her grip on the pulse of university drama, but no.
                    Ostensibly, she is a teacher because her job title is researcher but really she’s sat in a lab all
                    day.
                    Apparently, spending her days reading all the department emails which she’s cc’ed in on meaning
                    she’s
                    got the inside scoop on redundancies, departmental squabbles, and other staff grievances. It’s not
                    exactly the scandal and intrigue in <em>His Girl Friday</em>, but it does offer a peek behind the
                    academic velvet curtain.

                <h2>Wednesday, 20th November</h2>
                <p>
                    This evening marked a milestone: I produced my first solo radio show. Ghost was opposite me in the
                    booth, presenting with her usual flair. (Why she insists on using a pseudonym remains a mystery.
                    I've
                    long since stopped trying to decipher the eccentricities of the media society - it’s an endless
                    rabbit
                    hole.) My role? Sound checks, monitoring levels, ensuring everything ran smoothly. And it was… until
                    the
                    group chat erupted.
                    <br><br>
                    The messages started rolling in. All informing us that we were doing it wrong. In fact, that was the
                    common threat of all their messages. Verbatim: ‘You are doing it wrong’. Lacks a certain specificity
                    don’t you think. What? What is wrong? Tell me. The feed? Interference? A rogue cable? A meteor
                    striking
                    the studio? I wanted answers, but instead, I got a deluge of similarly unhelpful messages. It felt
                    like
                    trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing. Still, I kept my cool and reassured Ghost.
                    After
                    all, as the BBC speaker at last week’s talk so wisely put it: <em>“As producer, it’s your job to
                    smile
                    and wave, even if the sound mixer is ablaze.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    So, we soldiered on. Ghost was in her element, delivering a stellar show, while I maintained my
                    façade
                    of calm professionalism, inwardly unravelling the mystery of what’s gone wrong. Eventually, Angel,
                    our
                    station manager (currently gallivanting on a DMUGlobal trip in Croatia), swooped into the chat like
                    a
                    deus ex machina, ejecting the troublemakers. It turns out the culprits were a group of disgruntled
                    former members; students who’d been ousted from the society for violating some nebulous rules. From
                    what
                    I’ve gathered (a patchwork of whispered gossip and cryptic commentary from the board), their
                    bitterness
                    still festers.
                    <br><br>
                    With that drama resolved, the rest of the show ran like clockwork. Ghost dazzled, and I managed to
                    keep
                    everything humming along. And now? I’m apparently in demand as a producer for Friday’s medley show.
                    It
                    seems being a producer is prime real estate in the media society - everyone wants a show, but no one
                    wants to tackle the tech. Hot commodity or not, tonight was a success. Drama, feedback loops, and
                    all.

                <p>
                    I received my first email regarding the Paris trip happening in the spring next year. It looks like
                    there will be nineteen people in total, eleven girls and six boys, excluding myself. I can’t quite
                    figure out what it is that deters the lads from joining these kinds of trips. The same pattern
                    emerged
                    when I went to Bilbao in my first year, where only myself and two other guys went, compared to the
                    twelve girls on that trip. Not that I mind. I ended up meeting two of my closest friends, Natalia
                    and
                    Emily, on our visit to Spain. It’s easier to mingle in a group like that, especially when everyone
                    is
                    intrepid enough to sign up for the experience in the first place. You can usually count on them not
                    being the taciturn type.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon, I met Natalia to do a photography session. Not the same Natalia mentioned above,
                    this is
                    Polish Natalia. Wait, that doesn’t work, Natalia from Warsaw. Nope, that doesn’t either. Natalia who
                    does film production, who I met a few weeks ago. Yep, that works. We’re going out with our cameras
                    so
                    she can show me how to level up my photos. The first drops of snow were coming down and the
                    snowflakes
                    were large enough to see on camera, giving us a winter wonderland backdrop. After our session, we
                    ended
                    up in a coffee shop with our laptops. Since she’s also got experience in sound editing and
                    photoshop,
                    she’s in the process of teaching me those skills too. Turning out to be a very prosperous
                    friendship.

                <h2>Monday, 18th November</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the first module is over and I finally have time to breathe again, I can better appreciate the
                    subtle nuances I miss from Stockholm. The idiosyncrasies I had there, which once seemed so
                    inconsequential, are now uniquely tied to my experience in Sweden. Take, for instance, the ritual of
                    reading my Kindle every day on the metro. I still read now - I've just finished Lord of the Flies
                    (which, incidentally, has a fantastic ending) - but not with the same consistency or for the same
                    length
                    of time as I did last year. The 45-minute uninterrupted journey from Kista to the Frescati campus
                    offered the perfect opportunity to lose myself in a good book. These days, with my packed schedule
                    of
                    extracurriculars, I seldom have the luxury of a spare hour.
                    <br><br>
                    The most obvious aspect of Stockholm I miss is its idyllic charm - the canals, Gamla Stan, the royal
                    residence, and, of course, the meatballs. While I am more active and sociable in Leicester than I
                    ever
                    was in Stockholm, that does not imply I disliked my solitude there. Long walks through the city were
                    a
                    cherished routine - until the cold winter descended, at least.
                    <br><br>
                    Which brings me neatly to why I don’t entirely miss Stockholm. It was around this time last year
                    that
                    the plunging temperatures drove me indoors. I spent those months binge-watching Tom Baker’s seasons
                    of
                    <em>Doctor Who</em>, venturing out only for groceries or weekends away to other European capitals.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, for all I’m enjoying myself in Leicester, there remains something magical about my time in
                    Scandinavia - majestic, even. There was a quiet ostentation in being able to say, “I live in
                    Stockholm.”
                    It made people sit up and listen. Perhaps that’s what I miss most: the glamour, the sense of
                    reverence,
                    which Leicester, for all its merits, so conspicuously lacks.
                    <br><br>
                    It feels like I’ve been talking about Stockholm a lot recently. I’ve made a lot of new acquaintances
                    through clubs and societies and one of my best anecdotes starts with ‘During my year in Stockholm…’.
                    I’ve also been spending more time with Daria and a few of the other incoming exchange students which
                    is
                    why Stockholm is constantly on my mind. They all want to see as much of Leicester as they can whilst
                    they are here and expect me to give them tours. Unfortunately, my unadventurous first and second
                    years
                    have left me in the same position as them - wanting to explore a city I’ve never fully discovered
                    myself. It’s a bit embarrassing, considering I’ve already lived here for two years.

                <p>
                    My module is finished and yet I still find myself in the basement of the library at quarter past
                    eight
                    on a Saturday morning. Why would anyone be in the library at that ungodly hour the day after the
                    exams?
                    Well, foolishly I left my keyboard in the Radio studio last night so I needed to hasten back to get
                    it
                    before it was stolen. Seeing that I was on campus, I might as well start working whilst it’s quiet.
                    I
                    have no official deadlines however there are certain topics and skills that I want to learn or
                    remind
                    myself of whilst I have some free time. It would have been a great revision session had it not been
                    for
                    the open day tours disturbing me every fifteen minutes.

                    All that preparation. The countless hours immersed in esoteric concepts, navigating the labyrinth of
                    Big
                    Data and AI. All those efforts distilled into a multiple-choice quiz that was over in a mere five
                    minutes. 18 out of 20. With 80% of the module now complete, I’ve already secured more than enough to
                    clinch a first. And that’s without factoring in the case analysis, still pending evaluation.
                    <br><br>
                    A year ago, I was grappling with essay-style answers for each question in my exams, assessments
                    stretching to four-hour marathons. Now, I’m breezing through quizzes tied to a single lecture from
                    just
                    two weeks prior. I can't complain - I've learned plenty. Yet, the stark contrast between the two
                    systems
                    is striking, almost unsettling. And this, despite the UK’s standing as a global paragon of
                    education.
                    With the module behind me, a week of respite awaits. It’s important I use this time effectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Like spending it in the radio studio. Friday nights are the Demon FM meetings where we are learning
                    the
                    inner-workings of the mixer desk and the software. Tonight was a small gathering since it is the
                    final
                    day of the module and most people are getting their coursework finished by the midnight deadline. It
                    gave me more time on the decks and the Zetta network. It’s a lot to take in but rather intuitive
                    therefore I’m confident that I’ll be able to pick it up. Producing sounds like a nice gig. I don’t
                    need
                    to be on the microphones and I can control everything from behind the sound desk. Sounds like a
                    perfect
                    job. However that means it’s down to me to be trigger-ready on the mute buttons if I think a swear
                    is
                    coming. Ofcom takes that sort of stuff seriously, <em>apparently</em>.

                <p>
                    Another day of revision. I am dedicating most of my days to the exam I have tomorrow. I have been a
                    regular in the library and have been recapping everything. Rather superfluously, I should add since
                    I
                    only need a paltry five correct answers out of twenty to achieve my 70% target overall.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, I also received another delightful email from DMUGlobal - their messages seem to be the
                    highlight
                    of my inbox. In case I haven’t mentioned, I’ll be heading to Paris in April. Exciting huh. Just days
                    after my participation was confirmed, I was invited to apply for additional funding. Normally, I’d
                    overlook such an offer, given that I come from a comfortably low-middle-class background. But to my
                    surprise, I actually meet three out of the six eligibility criteria. Traditionally, funding has been
                    more targeted at students from BAME backgrounds or low-income neighbourhoods. However, DMU seems to
                    be
                    broadening its criteria, recognising that support should extend to a wider range of demographics.
                    They
                    now consider factors like parents' educational background, status as a mature student, or whether
                    one
                    comes from an economically challenged postcode. Thanks to these adjustments, I qualify for an extra
                    £200
                    in funding, meaning that my trip to Paris will cost me only £25 in total. Propitiously, I didn’t
                    even
                    need to resort to the usual tactics of persuasion or subtle manipulation that I sometimes rely on
                    advertising my harrowing cleft palate condition.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, the cutlery thief has struck again. This is ridiculous.

                    100% in the coursework - a personal record for me. In Stockholm when I needed to present, I always
                    found
                    it daunting and intimidating. Even if the code worked and had no issues, my grade rested on whether
                    I
                    could persuade the lecturer, who I’d barely spoken to, of its authenticity. This morning was
                    different
                    though. I had Dilan next to me and Osama is a much gentler figure than the weight-lifting,
                    ex-wrestling,
                    former-female heavyweight Swedish boxing champion, Beatrice Acklebloom who was my programming
                    professor
                    in Stockholm. (Quite a resume she’s got too!) I now only have the phase test on Friday and then
                    that’s
                    the module over. Because of how it’s weighted, I only need 15% in the exam to end the module with a
                    first. Quite a result given my apathy for Mobile App Development.
                    <br><br>
                    This afternoon, I attended a careers day hosted by the BBC, this time focused on opportunities in
                    radio
                    for students. Although radio isn’t exactly my field, the event still resonated with the professional
                    paths I’m exploring - and it's not every day the Beeb comes to town! I’m keeping my options open,
                    but
                    I’m still uncertain about what I want to pursue after graduation. Data analysis, web development,
                    media
                    production, writing... so many choices and so little time.

                    classic pub-grub, and dive into a lineup of games. No hacking, coding, or tech talk, just pure fun.
                    We
                    played chess, Uno, Cards Against Humanity, Mario Kart, and Wii Sports. Honestly, it felt like a
                    ten-year-old's birthday party, and I loved every minute of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the crowd already knew each other from last year’s society, so they had a good sense of who
                    to
                    avoid in chess. Given that everyone here is either a Computer Science or Cyber Security major - and,
                    let’s just say, equipped with a distinctly analytical mindset - I assumed they’d all be like Magnus
                    Carlsen on the chessboard. Feeling somewhat emboldened from my victory against a first year, I
                    challenged Jack, the reigning Hackers champion. His reputation clearly preceded him, as no one else
                    seemed willing to take him on.
                    <br><br>
                    We sat down, and the game was afoot. Twenty-five minutes later, I had him checkmated. Turns out,
                    what I
                    have can’t be taught. I am inimitable… As I declared checkmate, a collective “ooo” resonated across
                    the
                    room. There’s a new sheriff in town, folks.
                    <br><br>
                    The night continued, and I was in high spirits, still riding the thrill of my chess victory. Soon,
                    <em>Trivial
                        Pursuit</em> made an appearance. Although my knowledge of general world trivia is iffy at best,
                    it
                    didn’t seem to matter with the usual barrage of obscure questions. Then, a twist of fate: <em>Doctor
                    Who
                    Trivial Pursuit</em>. Apparently, Hackers Society could just as easily be a Whovian club, as
                    everyone
                    around the table turned out to be die-hard fans. Now I was genuinely excited.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting among Doctor Who enthusiasts, exchanging theories, dissecting episodes, actors, storylines,
                    plot
                    twists, and character arcs, was a dream come true. Honestly, this group might even be more dedicated
                    than the official Doctor Who Society (who, I suspect, may be more about cosplay and waving around
                    sonic
                    screwdrivers). All those hours I spent on IMDb were about to pay off. And although the competition
                    was
                    friendly, just as I’d seized Jack’s chess crown, I now had my sights on Emma’s <em>Doctor Who
                    Trivial
                    Pursuit</em> title. “You can name all of Season One’s episodes? That’s great! I can name them all,”
                    I
                    said, trying to sound casual, though I probably didn’t pull it off.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I knew it, I was put to the test, rattling off all 178 episodes since the 2005 reboot. When I
                    finished, everyone chipped in to pay for my meal. Finally, some recognition for all those hours
                    spent
                    rewatching and researching.
                    <br><br>
                    The game only intensified, with more arcane Doctor Who trivia - details I’d picked up after my
                    twentieth
                    rewatch of certain episodes or while researching actors, Murray Gold’s scores, and writers on IMDb.
                    There were even some classic Who questions, which I aced, thanks to binge-watching Tom Baker’s
                    seasons
                    while in Stockholm. If I hadn’t discovered film noir back in January, I’d probably still be working
                    my
                    way through Sylvester McCoy’s episodes by now. I suppose I have Humphrey Bogart and Orson Welles to
                    thank for interrupting my Whovian marathon.
                    <br><br>
                    So naturally, I won Trivial Pursuit too, securing a newfound respect from my fellow Hackers. King of
                    the
                    Nerds, undisputed. I imagine this is how Sam Spade must have felt after cracking the Maltese Falcon
                    case
                    - cool, confident, and holding all the cards. Only in my case, the cards were Doctor Who trivia and
                    Uno.
                    As I walked out of Firebug, I just needed a thick fog to roll in, a flickering street lamp, and some
                    jazz playing in the background - just a detective wrapping up another case, leaving a trail of
                    awestruck
                    witnesses in my wake.<em>“That’s the stuff that dreams are made of.”</em>

                <p>
                    You may remember I wrote a detailed account delineating the highs and lows of my erasmus year and
                    presented it in <a href="#Nov4">the form of advice</a>. Well, today I checked the Padlet page where
                    all
                    the entries were
                    submitted and, alas, mine has been omitted entirely, even after my revisions to align it with the
                    university’s tone. Sometimes the truth is raw, unpolished and not always what we expected, but
                    nevertheless, veracity should be rewarded instead of these congruent narratives which everyone is
                    peddling. So that annoyed me more than it probably should have. Particularly, taking into account
                    the
                    hours it took me to write all three sections comprehensively.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, closer to home, it appears a thief walks among us. I began the year with three of each
                    utensil, yet now I’m down to a single knife, two spoons, and two forks. One item gone could be an
                    accident, a simple misplacement. But this - this is a pattern. There’s no other explanation. I’m
                    sharing
                    a space with a cutlery thief. When I catch them in the act, well... let’s just say they may find
                    themselves on the wrong end of my remaining knife.

                <h2>Sunday, 10th November</h2>
                <p>
                    That’s it. I’ve completely finished the coursework section of the course. Submitted the application
                    in
                    conjunction with the 4500-word report I hammered out today. It only took eleven hours, but what’s
                    time
                    but just a man-made construct to measure the days we’ve passed and... the days we have left, I
                    guess?
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I am both exhausted and, strangely, a little wired. 4500 words. Four-thousand-five-hundred
                    words. That’s like… a short novella or a marathon in word form. Or is it? I don’t even know what
                    constitutes "a lot of words" anymore because my brain has been processing ideas for so long that
                    everything just looks like text and deadlines. Maybe I should submit my report for my writers room
                    submission? See how much fun they have learning about Mobile App Development. It’s funny because,
                    for
                    the past few hours, I’ve been this mad typing machine, like my fingers were on autopilot. I’m not
                    even
                    sure if all of it makes sense, but here’s hoping coherence stuck around through the sleep
                    deprivation.
                    <br><br>
                    And now that it’s done, I feel this weird mix of accomplishment and aimlessness. Like, what am I
                    supposed to do with myself now? I’ve been planning and stressing over this coursework for so long
                    that
                    it’s like I’ve forgotten how to not be working on it. Should I take a nap? Binge something mindless?
                    Or
                    should I just... sit here and stare at a wall, you know, contemplate existence and how words like
                    “4500”
                    and “done” feel good but, like, also anticlimactic? Because that’s where I’m at. I guess I’ll just
                    go to
                    bed…

                <p>
                    Got my first job interview scheduled. One of the companies who attended the Careers event that I
                    mentioned on Thursday are holding interviews the week commencing the 18th. I was aware that they
                    were
                    hiring one person to complete a six week summer internship exclusively from DMU so I guess everyone
                    got
                    an email saying the same thing. I know it’s inconsequential but it annoys me when the career advisor
                    starts the email with ‘Congratulations, you’ve been selected to interview …” intentionally making it
                    sound like it was just a handful of us when in reality, everyone who signed up got an opportunity to
                    interview. On the day, I even mentioned to the session leader that I had no experience using the
                    tech
                    stack which they use so I don’t exactly think that it will be a propitious interview. I guess I can
                    go
                    and talk about the broader concepts of Web Development and if I get past the first hurdle, I can
                    learn
                    the coding side of the job over Christmas. It’ll be good interview practice regardless.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, that coursework which I’ve been doing for the past fortnight is due on Monday at 10am in
                    conjunction with a report detailing the different components of the app and explaining the
                    functionality. The latter part of the assignment completely slipped my mind. It’s 10pm on a Saturday
                    night so tomorrow is going to be a busy day writing up everything which we’ve built over the past
                    two
                    weeks. Oh my favourite day of the week, soured by the incessant bore of coursework…

                <h2>Friday, 8th November</h2>
                <p>
                    I submitted my first submission for the Demon Media magazine today. The deadline is Monday. Because
                    of
                    the vast interest in writing, the editor-in-chief has decided to limit the submission to one article
                    per
                    person for now. As we move into the second half of the year, it is expected the interest will
                    subside
                    and I’ll be able to write a few more per edition. The theme is Winter/Christmas so I wrote an
                    anodyne
                    piece on the top ten films to rewatch this year. I’ve included the classics and even snuck in The
                    Bishop’s Wife in the honourable mentions section.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m still interested in taking over the website but I keep getting shrugged off by the head of the
                    Media
                    society. The new website was expected ‘imminently’ however that was over a month ago and still no
                    new
                    website. I’m at the point where I’m almost sure they are going to keep the same webpage but change
                    the
                    stylesheet associated with it. That will satisfy their definition of updating it. Until this happens
                    though, I’m going to keep badgering them.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening I was attending the Demon FM workshop for the new intake of participants. As I’m
                    writing
                    this, I’ve just realised that today has been all Demon Media. Either writing for the magazine,
                    editing
                    or production training. As I have no intention of doing a radio show - my interest lies in the
                    software
                    and hardware - my services have been offered to anyone who needs them. Normally the people who are
                    planning their own shows but don’t have the technical know-how to set up the equipment or operate
                    the
                    program we use. From what I can see, it is an intuitive system for beginners so it looks like I’ll
                    be in
                    high demand when the new schedule kicks off after Christmas for the new shows going on air.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, a bit of a digression; a student arrived on campus wearing a MAGA cap and began openly
                    endorsing
                    some of Trump’s more controversial policies. The situation quickly escalated. By the time campus
                    security showed up, the student had a black eye, and there was blood on the pavement. It’ll be
                    interesting to see how the university addresses this incident. There was clear provocation, but the
                    university’s commitment to maintaining a safe, inclusive environment may take precedence over
                    assigning
                    blame. It seems likely they’ll aim to address the incident through the lens of campus safety rather
                    than
                    dissecting the motivations behind it.

                    DMU Hackers is really starting to heat up. We’ve finally shed the dead weight—the people who only
                    showed
                    up for something to add to their CV. Now, we’re diving into more serious topics, like network
                    attacks
                    and Linux machine vulnerabilities. Although I’m studying Computer Science, I wouldn’t label myself a
                    “hacker.” In IT speak, I’m more of a “coder” within the software development side of things, so I
                    was
                    learning new stuff right along with everyone else tonight.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, this evening, I got an email from a careers advisor. It turns out my name has been mentioned
                    to a
                    few employers, including companies in the same circles as JLR and Peregrine. Remember that careers
                    day I
                    participated in a <a href="#oct17">few weeks back?</a> Apparently, I made a solid impression, and my
                    CV
                    has been making the rounds. I’m not entirely sure I authorised this sharing, but if it leads to a
                    graduate position, I might just let the data privacy concerns slide as part of the deal.

                    Celebrations, the coursework is finished. 18:34 to mark the exact time. Dilan and I did a nine hour
                    coding session today to hammer it out. Of course, all of my commits were done under Dilan’s
                    scrupulous
                    supervision. I would like to say that it was a fifty-fifty split of the workload but that would be
                    disingenuous. Actually, when we come to present out application on Monday to our lecturer, that is
                    exactly what I’ll be saying but given the enormity of the transgression I made yesterday, (Dilan
                    spent
                    much of the day and last night rectifying that mistake whilst I was out enjoying myself at Loftus
                    Road),
                    Dilan completed most of the back-end functionality, adapters, list views, database links and error
                    checks. What did I do, you might ask. Well, I made it look nice and the User Interface is the most
                    important part wouldn’t you say? To put it another way: if we were building a car, Dilan had built
                    the
                    engine, chassis, suspension, electrics and transmission, but I turned it from a Mini Cooper into a
                    Lamborghini. I feel like I need a lie down. Dilan’s going straight to bed. I suppose he’s deserved
                    it
                    after staying up most of the night fixing my errors. Did I mention he’s also got a cold? Poor lad.

                    our
                    coursework like a bull on steroids. We’re implementing features that are so far beyond the design

                    original. We don’t just aim for the stars; we’re trying to lasso a comet. (Thank you Mehmet for that
                    poetic metaphor). Our work was cruising along like a well-oiled machine, until, in a moment of utter
                    brilliance (or perhaps sheer lunacy), I decided to upload a piece of faulty code. You know, the kind
                    of
                    code that makes even the most forgiving compiler throw up its virtual hands in despair.
                    <br><br>
                    To put this into perspective for you non-techies, imagine you’re Mr Blandings, meticulously planning
                    your dream home. You’ve got the blueprints all sorted, the silk drapes ordered, and the crystal
                    countertops sparkling. Everything’s perfect until I waltz in, muddy boots and all, armed with a
                    sledgehammer and a questionable sense of architectural integrity. One swing, and suddenly, you’re
                    not
                    standing on your dream oasis anymore. That’s right, I turned your dream house into a pile of rubble
                    faster than you can say “renovation nightmare.” You’re shaking your head in disbelief; standing in
                    the
                    ruins of what was once your tranquil paradise, now reduced to a chaotic mess of shattered dreams and
                    splintered wood. That’s me right now. I broke it. Incorrigibly and irreparable. Like a toddler with
                    a
                    crayon in a museum, I’ve left my mark all over our once-glorious project.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m watching Dilan descend into insanity as he tries to repair my handwork. What would make my
                    transgression even worse? Leaving at the pivotal moment to go to London to watch the Boro play. I
                    guess
                    I’ve given Dilan something to do whilst I’m away. There’s the common saying that teamwork makes the
                    dream work - unless one of the teammates is me … with a sledgehammer.

                <h2>Monday, 4th November</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I received an email from Dalia, the DMU Global exchange officer in charge of preparing and
                    advising incoming and outgoing exchange students. Her primary role at the moment is persuading
                    current
                    students to undertake an Erasmus year for 2025/26 and in order to aid her in her mission, she’s
                    asked
                    last year's Erasmus alumni to write their thoughts and perspectives in a forum to show to potential
                    candidates. Questioning if I should talk about the fallacies of living abroad or the harsh
                    realities, I
                    settled on including some of the points I mentioned in last Wednesday’s blog; opting for veracity
                    rather
                    than embellishment.
                    <br><br>
                    So, the email. I figured it was going to be a <em>‘It would be in your best interests to write
                    something
                    positive’</em> type of email after being overtly critical of certain things, but to my surprise,
                    Dalia
                    was actually quite pleased with the straightforwardness of my review. What she wasn’t so thrilled
                    about,
                    however, was my laissez-faire attitude toward the law. Words like ‘fraudulent’ and ‘expedient’ made
                    their way into her critique.
                    <br><br>
                    She made it abundantly clear that the conclusion needed to be toned down to something more anodyne,
                    something the university could stand behind without breaking a sweat. Specifically, she had a
                    problem
                    with my closing line: <em>“Remember, nothing’s illegal if you’re foreign.” </em>Apparently, this
                    isn’t
                    the kind of stance the university wants to be associated with. Go figure. What happened to freedom
                    of
                    Speech? This used to be a respectable country.

                <h2>Sunday, 3nd November</h2>
                <p>
                    I love days like today. Absolutely love them. Mornings filled with coding and afternoons packed with
                    football and Formula One. It’s a ritual I’ve followed for years, though the company has changed over
                    time. Gone are the days when I’d lock myself in my room, tuning out the world. Now, I spend my
                    Sunday
                    afternoons at Soar Point – the social hub where sports and quizzes and everything society related is
                    based.
                    <br><br>
                    The atmosphere here is electric on matchdays. When the DMU football teams gather, the three rows of
                    tables are reserved giving us the best seats in the house. As expected, they’re a passionate bunch,
                    all
                    fervently loyal to their team but there’s always room for humour. Honestly, it’s a miracle the Man
                    Utd
                    fans keep coming back, given the relentless banter they endure every week. Also you may remember I
                    handed in my resignation from the futsal team a few weeks ago. Well today, I’ve met my replacement.
                    Aaron Smith from Cornwall. I couldn’t make it up. The white boy paragon: <em>indie music, The
                    Office,
                    crossfit, kitted out in North Face apparel, and overusing phrases like “oh my gosh”</em>. I’ll let
                    you
                    make your own conclusions.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the football winds down, it’s time for classic pub grub - and not the bacteria on toast I
                    half-expect at some places. We’re talking juicy burgers, crispy chicken kievs, cheesy pizzas - the
                    kind
                    of comfort food that even my picky appetite can’t resist.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the football fans clear out, the Karting and Racing societies flood in, eager to claim the
                    newly
                    vacated seats. The atmosphere stays just as charged, especially this week with the chaos of the
                    Brazilian Grand Prix. The unpredictable weather turned what should have been a straightforward
                    ninety-minute race into a two-and-a-half-hour epic, complete with cars spinning off track, safety
                    car
                    interventions, and red flags galore.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the boys here are die-hard McLaren fans, and for them, Lando Norris is the local hero. With
                    Norris starting on pole and Max Verstappen all the way down in seventeenth, it felt inevitable that
                    the
                    gap in the Driver’s Championship standings would shrink to just 25 points. A thrilling prospect, and
                    the
                    tension was palpable.
                    <br><br>
                    But in true Formula One fashion, everything unravelled. The McLaren strategy left everyone
                    frustrated,
                    and when Max pulled off the drive of his career to take the win, drinks went flying in frustration,
                    a
                    spectacular show of collective disappointment. Yet, in the midst of all the drama, Alpine quietly
                    secured an impressive second and third place. Not that anyone here really noticed—or cared, for that
                    matter.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s it. Another perfect Sunday concluded. Admittedly, some weekends are better than others
                    based
                    on external factors such as whether it was a successful week in Fantasy or if I’ve got a headstart
                    on
                    the coming week's lectures. Nevertheless, today was a good day.

                <p>
                    It’s Bonfire Night. Normally not something I would go out of my way for however, a rare stroke of
                    fortune had earned me a ticket. A little caveat of winning was the dubious pleasure of being a
                    chaperone
                    for the group of exchange students from all corners of the university. It seemed that fate (or, in
                    more
                    practical terms, the raffle drum) had decreed I be here. Otherwise, I’d have been watching the F1
                    qualifying and trying to complete my coursework so really this was a grand procrastination
                    excursion.
                    <br><br>
                    Daria, the perpetually cheerful Exchange Liaison who I met at the meeting on Wednesday, was already
                    herding our diverse flock when I arrived. The group was eclectic, with students from various
                    faculties
                    and from all over the globe. I spoke to a large number of them about what drew them to Leicester and
                    for
                    most, the answer was, they wanted to be in the UK - anywhere in the UK. A couple of them had
                    travelled
                    from Stockholm University, and in a twist of serendipity, they actually shared my general cynicism
                    about
                    university administration. It was a relief, honestly. Usually, conversations in these settings
                    spiral
                    into small talk about weather, coursework, or travel itineraries, but here were people willing to
                    engage
                    in what I’d call my “status quo grievances.” We had a lively discussion, which made the whole affair
                    feel less forced. Shared disillusionment has a way of bringing people together, doesn’t it?
                    <br><br>
                    Bonfire Night was held in Abbey Park, but the whole event had morphed into something almost
                    unrecognisable from my childhood. I remember when this night was simpler: kids running around with
                    sparklers, their eyes wide with wonder. Back then, it was a neighbourhood affair—a yearly ritual
                    where
                    community spirit briefly overshadowed everything else. Now, the event felt industrialised, swallowed
                    up
                    by consumerism. A £30 entry fee for what was essentially an amusement park. Food trucks lined the
                    area,
                    fairground rides rattled the ground beneath our feet, and LED-light wands were being sold to eager
                    and
                    impressionable kids. A live band played on the periphery, adding to the spectacle. Thankfully, I got
                    in
                    for free, because my frugal nature doesn’t consider this kind of extravagance a luxury worth paying
                    for.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I made use of the situation. With my camera, I captured moments both mundane and magical. The
                    bonfire itself, a towering inferno crackling against the night sky, made for some striking shots.
                    Fireworks splintered into bursts of colour, and for a fleeting second, it almost made me forget
                    about
                    the looming coursework deadlines hanging over me. Almost. There were genuine moments of joy,
                    especially
                    among the exchange students, and I found myself appreciating the odd patch of laughter or the sudden
                    gasp of delight when the sky exploded into fractals of light.
                    <br><br>
                    The event was sprawling, drawing a crowd of what must have been close to 10,000 people. Despite
                    this, or
                    perhaps because chaos favours coincidence, I managed to run into Nat and Mehmet. It’s funny how that
                    happens, isn’t it? A field filled with strangers, and yet two friends materialise right in front of
                    you.
                    Nat was, predictably, carrying a giant cup of overpriced hot chocolate, while Mehmet complained
                    about
                    the “atrocious” music selection. To be fair, I agree with him. We shared some laughs, our critiques
                    of
                    the night interwoven with genuine moments of camaraderie. Mehmet, in his usual theatrical fashion,
                    declared that this was “all a load of bollocks” while simultaneously stealing marshmallows from a
                    nearby
                    stand when the vendor’s back was turned. I’m starting to like him more and more.
                    <br><br>
                    As the night wore on, I found myself conflicted. Bonfire Night wasn’t what it used to be, but
                    perhaps it
                    wasn’t meant to be. Traditions change, evolve, and are often co-opted by the ever-hungry machine of
                    consumer culture. Yet, I found a kind of solace in the unexpected: a group of exchange students, a
                    couple of like-minded cynics from Stockholm, and friends reappearing in a field lit up by fire and
                    noise. Maybe, despite my gripes and my instinct to critique, the night had something to offer after
                    all.
                    Or maybe I’m just grasping at straws, trying to give meaning to a night I didn’t really want to
                    attend.
                    Who knows? Either way, I got some good photos out of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, trying to explain the importance of Bonfire night to international students is harder than I
                    thought. Yes, I told them the tale about Guy Fawkes trying to destroy parliament to remove
                    Protestant
                    rule and replace it with Catholic leadership. But why do we celebrate this? We don’t celebrate the
                    last
                    person to be hanged in this country by selling miniature hanging sets and tying mannequins up with a
                    noose. That’s the great thing about getting people from other cultures coming to England. They look
                    at
                    our traditions with a fresh perspective and can discover just how bizarre they are to outsiders. I
                    can’t
                    wait to hear their views on Panto season.

                    One deadline down, another one in seven days. This one involves programming a functioning
                    application so

                    I’ve
                    been here for so long that I am wanting to drop the module. Surely, I can just <em>live off the

                <p>
                    Today, I had the fantastic opportunity to join a BBC Writers Room Zoom call—a Q&A about what to
                    expect
                    for their upcoming Open Call. For a full month, the BBC Writers Room opens its submission portal to
                    anyone with a story to tell. This means writers of all backgrounds can submit scripts for TV dramas,
                    radio plays, comedies, children’s shows, and more. The BBC will then review every submission,
                    seeking
                    promising voices to nurture and develop into accomplished writers. The selection process is highly
                    competitive, but it’s an incredible chance to break into the industry. I’d be remiss not to give it
                    a
                    shot by submitting one of my own stories and seeing where it might lead.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I think about which story I’m submitting, I’ve got to proofread my 4000 word case analysis
                    before
                    tomorrow's midday deadline. It is 99% finished; I just need to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Once
                    that’s out the way, I can focus on building our coffee shop mobile application before the deadline
                    next
                    weekend. Dilan has almost finished the front end features, so I need to catch up to complete the
                    admin
                    side of things. I’ve also been assigned the task of writing the documentation also because ‘I have a
                    way
                    with words’.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the topics which came up yesterday at the exchange debrief was the Abbey Park Bonfire taking
                    place on Saturday night. It’s normally £30 but I received an email this afternoon from DMUGlobal
                    stating
                    that I have won a ticket in the raffle. There are twenty-four of us going in total - a mix of DMU
                    students and incoming exchange students so Amena has warned me to be on my best behaviour. I think
                    this
                    was a tacit reminder to not scare off the new intake, which is ironic considering it’s the one time
                    of
                    year where scares are permitted. That should be something to look forward to in any case. I have a
                    few
                    new tricks I want to try out with my camera after getting private lessons from a new friend from the
                    media society who is doing photography as part of her course.

                <h2>Wednesday, 30th October</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re on fire! Literally. We were told upon moving in that if the fire alarm were ever to sound for
                    longer than two minutes, it is not a drill. Because I’m sceptical by nature, probably a hindrance
                    rather
                    than a strength in this scenario, I waited for five minutes before deciding to head out. I knew it
                    was
                    for real by the panicked countenance of the staff; all lining up on the other side of the road with
                    their matching high-vis jackets on, trying to herd everyone to the end of the road. I didn’t stick
                    around because I had the Erasmus debrief at the campus. This was an opportunity for everyone who had
                    attended a University abroad, to catch up, exchange stories, and ultimately try to make everyone
                    jealous
                    about their chosen city so how could I resist. Little did I know that it would be me that was made
                    jealous.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a small gathering. Intimate enough for everyone to be heard. There were some faces which I
                    recognised from the departure meetings and some new who were just brimming with mirth to share their
                    anecdotes. Hearing their tales made me realise just how unfulfilled my time abroad was. I could list
                    my
                    excuses; the campus was outside of the city, I was the only Englishman in the faculty, there were no
                    societies or clubs specifically for erasmus students. The list could go on, but I have to accept
                    that
                    the
                    main problem was me. I tried to be approachable and gregarious. Going on museum trips with people
                    from
                    my accommodation, I played futsal as frequently as I could in the Sports centre. I met plenty of
                    people
                    but most/all remained just passing acquaintances. My only faithful companion was my shadow, but even
                    he
                    left during the four months of snow and saturnine weather.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t think this was all my fault. The herd mentality of the Germans or the piss-poor organisation
                    of
                    events by Stockholm University didn’t help but rather hindered my involvement throughout the year.
                    This
                    may be a weak vindication, but it doesn’t change the fact that if it wasn’t for futsal, I could have
                    completed the course from my room in Darlington. What was I supposed to say when asked about the
                    great
                    things I did? The winter started in early November and didn’t end till late March, so I stayed in my
                    room
                    watching Film Noir. When the sun came out again in the Spring, I was counting down the days till it
                    was
                    over. I did go travelling to the surrounding countries which is memorable but what sort of
                    advertisement
                    is that for my year in Stockholm. ‘The best thing I did was leave to explore other places’.
                    <br><br>
                    I felt a profound emptiness watching others revel in the experiences I had hoped to share. How
                    different
                    it all would have been had I gained admission to my first choice in Charleston, South Carolina. What
                    aggravates me most is the absurdity of my own decision-making: I am studying Spanish - SO WHY DIDN’T
                    I
                    GO TO FUCKING SPAIN. That was, quite possibly, the greatest opportunity I’ll ever have to immerse
                    myself. My rationale at the time was that Deusto University in Bilbao was my only option, a city I’d
                    already visited. But truly, did that matter? Tilly, a girl in the debrief, spent the year in
                    Barcelona
                    and now she is almost fluent in Spanish.
                    <br><br>
                    I get incredibly depressed when I reminisce. Such a great opportunity spurned. Was it the place, the
                    people or me? Whatever it was, it’s over now. It’s on my degree. I just wished I had better memories
                    associated with my time away. Fun anecdotes which I could share. People who I’ve kept in touch with.
                    Instead, I’m left with embellishments and fantasies that mask the reality of that year: the course
                    was
                    online, the people were distant, and the city was cold.
                    <br><br>
                    To try and find some positives from the meeting; I met some cool new people who are worldly and
                    intrepid. We also met with the first group of incoming exchange students studying at DMU for the
                    first
                    semester. Masking my dejection, I played the part we were expected to play and welcomed the new
                    students
                    with warmth and excitement though I felt like I wanted to be a million miles away.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, St Martin’s House is still standing so I assume it was only a small conflagration.

                <p>
                    Do dreams signify anything real? That was the discussion at the magazine meeting this evening.
                    Horoscopes, tea leaves, dreams - I tend to fall on the side of science. Premonitions and out-of-body
                    experiences are purely chemical reactions that are interpreted as something ethereal due to external
                    factors. Dreams are just your subconscious stringing together random thoughts and populating them
                    with
                    real people or locations. Excuse my incredulity, but solipsism will get me much further in life than
                    the
                    belief in mythical or ostensible pantheons. My philosophical stance, which holds that one’s own mind
                    is
                    the only certainty, should convey my scepticism regarding this sort of thing, but I am not here to
                    convert others to my pessimistic beliefs. If they want to assign credence and meaning to dreams -
                    even
                    though they lack empirical support - I will indulge them.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe it’s because none of my dreams are meaningful or remotely insightful. Real life isn’t like the
                    movies, where one has a dream and then changes their entire life; goes travelling, gets married,
                    starts
                    a majestic new journey. Nope, mine are much more tangible. The only epiphany I’ve had, which came to
                    me
                    in a dream, is the realisation that university was the only way out of the rut I found myself in
                    four
                    years ago.
                    <br><br>
                    What does it mean when dreamers fixate on a single person? A dear friend, a lost loved one - do
                    these
                    dreams whisper secrets from our subconscious, inviting us to explore a reality that exists only in
                    the
                    playground of our minds? I find myself greeting my granddad every now and then. It’s not a
                    heart-wrenching reunion where I’m painfully reminded of his absence, nor a prophetic vision that
                    warns
                    me of what’s to come. No, it’s a simple acknowledgment, a moment where I can picture him standing
                    side
                    by side with Nana. In those dreams, I softly whisper, “It’s good to see you again,” cherishing the
                    fleeting connection that binds us beyond the veil of reality. Even if it is just a wave of
                    chemicals, a
                    surge of neurons firing in the night, I wake up feeling comforted by the memories that linger.
                    <br><br>
                    The afterlife isn’t a notion I readily embrace, but I refuse to diminish the hopes of those who do.
                    In
                    moments of quiet reflection, I can’t help but wonder about what lies beyond this life. My time here
                    feels precious, a gift I want to savour fully. I hold on to the belief that time is fleeting, that
                    what
                    will be will be. And in that understanding, I strive to make every moment count, finding meaning in
                    the
                    little things.

                <p>
                    Woke up to a wonderful email this morning - which is a nice change from the ominous, incessant
                    reminders
                    of coursework deadlines as per usual. I’m off to Paris! A DMUGlobal opportunity themed around
                    employability and team building skills. I must confess, my ulterior motive is to see the sights. I
                    have
                    been known to throw a sickie from time to time to have an adventure around London so I may deploy
                    these
                    similar tactics whilst in Paris too! <em>I always get a 24 hour flu around April anyway. </em> Paris
                    has
                    been on my itinerary for a while and this gives me the perfect opportunity to see the sights on the
                    university’s dime. During the DMUGlobal trip to Bilbao in 2021, there were several people ostensibly
                    suffering from heat stroke therefore remained in their rooms for two or three days. Yep - I was
                    dubious
                    about their excuses too. Paris however, is much larger than Bilbao and I only have a meagre five
                    days to
                    cover everything. I won’t have time for university organised activities - not with my full
                    itinerary.

                <p>
                    I just had one of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever experienced. Compared to the strident
                    environment
                    of the hostel, even my springy mattress felt like an upgrade. With two days off work, I had to race
                    against the clock to catch up on the progress Dilan had made in our coursework. We’ve exchanged our
                    Case
                    Analysis essays to peer review each other’s work before the Friday deadline. Dilan’s expertise is
                    firmly
                    rooted in coding—he knows the concepts inside and out—but translating those ideas into academic
                    vernacular is not his strong suit. It took me over two hours to decipher his work and shape it into
                    a
                    cohesive paper. His draft was weighed down with superfluous detail and language that felt too casual
                    for
                    an academic setting. Meanwhile, I have a whole lexicon of words I rarely use, like “good enough” or
                    “a
                    lot of.” Words like “efficient” and “plethora” feel far more mellifluous. It makes me appreciate the
                    writing journey I’ve been on over the years because I know I once wrote just like Dilan—expressing
                    ideas
                    without much thought for verbiage or a skill for succinct language.

                <p>
                    It’s 2:20 AM, and as I write this, I’m listening to the falsetto snores coming from the other bunks.
                    Each snorer sings at a different octave, slightly out of rhythm with the others. I can actually
                    monitor
                    which part of their sleep cycles they are in by the intermission of their snores, which is not
                    helpful
                    for getting back to sleep. I long for sleep, but my mind remains vigilant, refusing to rest in the
                    darkness. Since there is no hope of relief until my comrades in the trenches move into their non-REM
                    sleep patterns, let me tell you about my day.
                    <br><br>
                    The first problem I encountered was all the trains getting cancelled due to signalling issues. <em>The
                    sooner labour nationalise the railways, the bloody better.</em> Only one train was departing for
                    London,
                    so a
                    hundred passengers were rushing for a spot or a seat if you’re one of the lucky ones. I was on my
                    way to
                    the Capital and that’s all I could ask for.
                    <br><br>
                    Making it to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane with minutes to spare, I took my seat and witnessed one of
                    the
                    most inquisitive conversations I have ever seen about Shakespeare. I initially misunderstood the
                    format
                    of the interview; Greg Doran is not the host but the interviewee next to David Tennant. Given his
                    vast
                    portfolio of plays and productions - and his book to sell - it became evident that Tennant was only
                    there primarily for marketing purposes. Starting as an actor, Doran moved into directing in the '90s
                    and
                    has since completed Shakespeare productions from all three folios. If it were an interview with just
                    him, it would have still been intriguing but due to his backstage role, his reputation does not
                    garner
                    the same respect as David’s. But what a man. Full of anecdotes and wit. A truly-talented raconteur
                    with
                    a penchant for storytelling. I am more inclined to see one of his productions from observing the
                    talent
                    and discernment he has in approaching Shakespeare.
                    <br><br>
                    Next to me was a girl named Mary-Jane, a history major who just graduated from Edinburgh University.
                    We
                    shared stories and our Shakespeare favourites. Congenial people coming together to share an
                    experience—this is what I imagine Comic-Con is like. Everyone with the same passions in the same
                    room.
                    However, I must say that the theatre looked half-empty, possibly due to the train cancellations.
                    Covertly snapping a few photographs at the curtain call, I was pleased I moved my train forward a
                    day to
                    accommodate this interview.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    I may have just witnessed some of the best performances of my life. The intensity, the foreboding,
                    the
                    raw passion of a Shakespeare aficionado - it all left me in awe. I had forgotten how profoundly dark
                    Macbeth can be, but this production brought that darkness to life with majestic power. The script
                    stayed
                    true, almost verbatim, to the second folio. The emotions felt raw and genuine, with tears as real as
                    Macduff's searing vengeance against Macbeth. These are the Shakespearian greats which we are
                    witnessing
                    and their resonance is unparalleled.
                    <br><br>
                    This adaptation brought its own ingenuity to the performance by having the audience wear headphones
                    throughout. This allowed us to hear the witches' cackles and howls directly, bypassing the
                    challenges of
                    portraying them on stage. Each actor wore a microphone, enabling them to whisper their monologues,
                    so
                    the pain and intensity in their voices didn’t need to be projected across the theatre. The Celtic
                    overtones of the performance remained true to its Scottish roots, while an added ecclesiastical edge
                    made the experience even more ominous, with the sounds of disconcerting whispers playing directly in
                    our
                    ears.
                    <br><br>
                    This adaptation left me with a sense of awe and a renewed appreciation for the power of theatre. The
                    intimacy of the whispered lines and the eerie soundscapes drew me into the world of Macbeth like
                    never
                    before, making me feel as though I was right there amidst the turmoil and tragedy. It was a reminder
                    of
                    why I love Shakespeare—his ability to explore the depths of human emotion in ways that still
                    resonate
                    today. As I walked away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had witnessed something special,
                    something
                    that would stay with me long after the final echo of the witches’ cackle had faded.

                <h2>Friday, 25th October</h2>
                <p>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it’s back to London I go. With my student loans to fund the shows, heigh-ho,
                    heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s right. Back to the citadel. Why? Because Shakespeare demands it. <em>Thus fate, that hath
                        made me
                        servant to it,</em> leads me back to the Globe. Tonight, I am watching the penultimate matinee
                    of
                    The Taming
                    of the Shrew at the Globe Theatre; the final show of the season before the future productions move
                    indoors to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. I’m going to be well wrapped up, for the cold October air
                    can be
                    unforgiving when permeating the Wooden O. (Shakespeare described the Globe as the Wooden O in Henry
                    V).
                    <br><br>
                    But that’s not all. No disrespect to Petruchio and Katherina, but their love quarrel doesn’t warrant
                    a
                    trip to London by themselves. No, no, no—the pièce de résistance starts this afternoon with the
                    first of
                    two parts of my David Tennant extravaganza. I am watching an interview at the Royal Drury Theatre
                    hosted
                    by venerated Shakespeare impresario, Greg Doran interviewing the tenth doctor himself. This is in
                    addition to their ongoing run of Macbeth which I’m seeing tomorrow. The King of Scotland, played by
                    David Tennant, supported by Cush Jumbo starts at two pm. I have been flirting with these tickets for
                    months until one glorious day a few weeks ago where the last minute tickets were released at
                    cut-rate
                    prices. Low enough for me to justify the purchase. <em>And so let the wind grow cold and the night
                        creep
                        upon us; let the curtain rise on this thrilling adventure, and so, with eager hearts, we step
                        boldly
                        into the night, where our destinies await!</em>

                    PS. I am staying in a hostel for the first time in my life where I will be sharing my room with
                    three
                    other people like a common peasant. If I haven’t published a blog by Sunday evening detailing my
                    trip,
                    come looking for me. I’m staying at the Astor Hyde Park Hostel. <em>Please save me . . .</em>

                    This evening marked my second trip to the Globe Theatre in as many weeks. Taming of the Shrew is one
                    of
                    the few works in Shakespeare's body of work that hasn’t been significantly altered to align with
                    contemporary themes of female empowerment and social justice. I won’t provide a full analysis here,
                    as
                    most of you may not be interested, but I will publish my review elsewhere. I will say that it was a
                    slight disappointment compared to the high expectations I had. The culmination of the play didn’t
                    match
                    the anodyne tone established throughout, leaving me feeling unfulfilled. For a comedy, it relied too
                    heavily on modern contemporary language for laughs rather than on the nuanced Shakespearean lexicon
                    from
                    the script.
                    <br><br>
                    The journey to South Kensington was uneventful, yet a sense of trepidation coursed through me as
                    tales
                    of hostel living raced through my mind. The hostel felt somewhat incongruous given its surroundings.
                    The
                    street is lined with foreign embassies and law-firms, high-end real estates and Imperial College
                    London
                    sharing the same pathways. Just around the corner stands the Royal Albert Hall, a major landmark
                    steeped
                    in London’s history. In stark contrast to its elegant neighbours, the Astor hostel shares an
                    imposing
                    façade but lacks the decorous opulence within.
                    <br><br>
                    Friday night in a hostel has more in common with a nightclub than a hotel. The common room is a
                    chaotic
                    scene, littered with beer pong tables and DJ decks in the corner. There are spills, thrills, and
                    even
                    some pills being passed among travellers. The alcohol-stained wooden floors make every step a sticky
                    ordeal. Couples are canoodling on the stairs—apparently, a quick way to get to know the locals—and I
                    find myself stepping over something I’d rather not think about as I try to make my way to my room.
                    <br><br>
                    The room itself is sparse, furnished only with bunk beds. I’m sharing the space with three
                    others—Till,
                    Kenny, and Nuno, according to the labels on their bunks. I was ready for bed by midnight; I kept my
                    belongings close, slept in my clothes, and looped my backpack strap around my wrist. My parents
                    taught
                    me to be vigilant, to trust no one. I might be crafty in seizing opportunities, but I’m not a thief.
                    As
                    for these travellers? I don’t know their stories. Come first light, I’ll be out of here like a
                    whippet.

                <p>
                    It’s hacking time! Last week was the last taster session for DMU hackers which means this week is
                    exclusively for members only. Those of us who are serious about the subject. Being a final year
                    student
                    I have a quasi knowledge base surrounding the topics we will be covering. This evening, we were
                    starting
                    off easy by introducing the Linux operating system to the newbies. We were all beginners at some
                    point
                    so we need to be patient with them. Because I’m not part of the committee, I don’t need to help
                    these
                    neophytes out so I spent my time developing a brute force algorithm which can crack passwords in
                    less
                    than thirty seconds. Sounds impressive, but the real impetus is a bit more mundane—I forgot my
                    Airbnb
                    password, and I’ll need it soon.
                    <br><br>
                    After the session, it’s off to Soar Point, the student pub that’s the hub of society socials. I’m
                    involved in so many societies this year that I never enter the pub without finding at least one
                    group I
                    can comfortably join. Tonight, I spent the first half hour with my fellow coders, debating whether
                    Blockchain is overrated and if the moon landing could have been more efficient had the software been
                    built on open-source foundations. I bet your curiosity is almost palpable.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, I joined the Racing team for a few quick pub games before settling down with Mehmet to
                    watch
                    Fenerbahçe vs. Man Utd. As kickoff approached, more of his Turkish friends joined us, each one
                    welcomed
                    into the fold. It wasn’t until we left that I found out some of them were complete strangers. This
                    is
                    what I missed in Stockholm: a welcoming group of Englishmen where we could catch up and enjoy our
                    home
                    away from home. Instead, I was the only Brit in the Computer Science faculty there, and a social
                    pariah
                    among the Germans. <em>I probably shouldn’t have made those war jokes.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Surrounded by a dozen Turks, I knew they were passionate supporters, famous for setting off flares
                    and
                    chanting fiercely back home. It was no surprise when that same fervour filled Soar Point as
                    Fenerbahçe
                    scored, their rich footballing heritage coming alive in every cheer and shout. This is football at
                    its
                    finest. It was a stark contrast to the women’s game I watched in the pub a few weeks ago, where two
                    men
                    were escorted out for their overly enthusiastic behaviour.

                    The second day of the careers fair was just as informative as I’d hoped. It offered a chance for a
                    face-to-face with sectors beyond the IT realm, allowing me to explore whether I have transferable
                    skills
                    that might align with them. One opportunity that truly piqued my interest was a selection of
                    advertising
                    firms—billed as "1001 jobs under one roof." Their graduate schemes offer training across a wide
                    range of
                    fields, including writing, media, software, animation, and various other areas of production.
                    Hitherto,
                    I hadn't considered opportunities outside of Software Development or related IT roles, but I must
                    admit,
                    the prospect of applying is quite tempting.
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside the multitude of advertising firms, the automotive industry made a strong showing at the
                    fair.
                    High-end brands like Bentley and Aston Martin drew large crowds, much of which seemed driven by the
                    allure of working for such prestigious names. However, according to my friends in engineering,
                    unless
                    you’re joining at a senior or managerial level, it’s often more advantageous to start with a more
                    approachable brand like Mini or Volkswagen.
                    <br><br>
                    The demand for data scientists is strong, especially vis-a-vis software engineering roles—these
                    companies seek experts who can monitor telemetry, uncover patterns, and enhance UI/UX. Ironically,
                    many
                    of these automotive giants have their headquarters in Milton Keynes, which discourages some from
                    making
                    the move. As for me, I consider myself adaptable and would relocate wherever opportunity calls.

                    It’s crunch time. The case analysis has been released as well as the coding coursework. I have a
                    fortnight to complete both which is achievable but it does mean it’s going to be a long two weeks.
                    The
                    case analysis is simple. 4000 words delineating the ethics challenges of a fictitious company. (I
                    have
                    already completed 2000 words in three days.) The coursework is proving to be more tortuous,
                    especially
                    because I am paired with Dilan who wants to program it so it is compatible with the Starship
                    Enterprise.
                    My issue isn’t keeping up with the lectures and labs, it’s keeping up with Dilan’s vision for this
                    project. Nevertheless, it’s going to be the most advanced exercise on my portfolio regardless.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also prescient about what I want to be doing after university. Graduate schemes and
                    apprenticeships
                    are all being released in the coming weeks; therefore, the first careers fair of the season kicked
                    off
                    today. The companies that hosted the event last week were among those invited today. Peregrine, JLR,
                    and
                    Caterpillar all recognised me from those activities and strongly urged—using their exact
                    vernacular—that
                    I apply for their vacancies. Does it count as being headhunted if I am approached during a
                    recruitment
                    event? Nevertheless, I updated my CV yesterday in preparation. Some deadlines are as early as
                    November
                    1st, so it’s going to be a busy few weeks.

                    This evening, I had to break the bad news to the Futsal team that I’d have to retire from the season
                    before our first match. Why? Well, because my overly-scheduled timetable can’t accommodate the
                    intense
                    futsal schedule. The room went silent. There were looks of disbelief and incredulity all around,
                    like
                    I’d just announced that I was actually an alien in disguise.
                    <br><br>
                    “Wait, what do you mean you’re quitting?” someone blurted out. I couldn’t give them the real reason
                    so I
                    fabricated an injury. The audacity of it. The betrayal. Why would anyone want to quit football? They
                    couldn’t understand why the guy they nicknamed ‘Cole Palmer’ would want to focus on other things.
                    Meanwhile, the coach’s face looked like he’d just bitten into a lemon. More annoyed than
                    disappointed, I
                    could almost see the gears turning in his head: Great, the diversity hire has just quit my team. I
                    bet
                    he’s thinking that. I’ll find out for sure when I meet my replacement—probably some guy named
                    Charles
                    who plays lacrosse and ultimate frisbee. Goes hiking on a weekend and drives a Subaru Outback with a
                    mountain bike strapped to the roof. What a tit.
                    <br><br>
                    After some awkward goodbyes and a half-hearted “Stay in touch!” (which we all knew wouldn’t happen),
                    I
                    snuck upstairs to my Pilates class. As I lay on my mat, trying to channel my inner peace and hold a
                    bridge pose, I couldn’t help but contemplate my decisions. This is for the best. It’s my final year
                    and
                    I do have plenty of other commitments which I want to focus on. Writing for the Magazine, producing
                    for
                    the Demon FM, designing and developing the car components, attending Hack-a-thons with the Hackers.
                    This
                    is the best for the long run. At least I hope it is.

                    I finished reading the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath; the only full length novel published under her nom
                    de
                    plume Victoria Lucas, a few months before her death in 1963. Historically, it’s categorised as a
                    semi-autobiographical novel as Plath took inspiration from her own time spent in mental institutions
                    and
                    embellished the tales of her acquaintances from that time. I’m incredulous how no one knew she was
                    suicidal given the tell-tale signs in her work. Most of her short stories follow the same depressive
                    theme and include suicide or self-harm. If that wasn’t a salient hint, most are written in first
                    person.
                    She was literally transcribing her own pain and no one looked past the facade of her fictitious
                    stories.
                    The Bell Jar was particularly appealing for me because of the 50s setting which came with esoteric
                    references which I am proud to say I understood. Sydney Greenstreet, Gloria Grahame, Shelley
                    Winters.

                    Switching from the macabre subject of Sylvia Plath to the exciting prospects of a trip to Paris, I
                    have
                    submitted my application for the cultural integration and employability trip taking place in early
                    Spring. The deadline is Monday but since the case studio deadline for my coursework is in a
                    fortnight, I
                    don’t want any other distractions. Between now and then, I have applications which I want to submit
                    for
                    JLR, and a couple other companies from the careers day on Thursday. I have only just started my
                    final
                    year but most internship and graduate programs for the summer close their applications in the coming
                    months so I need to keep on top of that as well.

                <h2>Friday, 18th October</h2>
                <p>
                    My affinity for new experiences continued with the first session of Demon FM held in the campus
                    broadcasting studio. Backed by the DSU and the media faculty, I’m amazed by the apparent
                    indifference
                    toward the society, especially given all the amazing equipment we have at our disposal—cameras,
                    sound
                    gear, TV broadcasting decks, and everything needed to send signals out into the world. This raises
                    some
                    doubts about the activities and management structure, but for now, I’m keeping an open mind to all
                    the
                    information being shared.
                    <br><br>
                    I was especially eager for this evening’s session after enduring four long hours of seminars on
                    computer
                    ethics. My mind had wandered through a labyrinth of jargon and legalese, each term more tedious than
                    the
                    last. It felt like the life had been drained from the room, leaving behind a dull echo of buzzwords
                    and
                    ethical dilemmas that seemed to spiral into an abyss of ambiguity. Yawn. Normally, I wouldn’t
                    approach
                    any part of a module with apathy, but I have already completed two modules dedicated to computer
                    ethics
                    during my tenure at De Montfort.
                    <br><br>
                    The only positive from enduring this academic purgatory was getting a rundown of the case study
                    which
                    accounts for 20% of our grade for this module: a 4000 word essay delineating the challenges and
                    opportunities a fictitious start-up faces when trying to balance innovation with ethics. Simple
                    enough.
                    I get a certain Joie de vivre as Delboy would say, from writing essays but I feel like my penmanship
                    is
                    being curtailed by others who use AI to complete their essays. It is hard to discern excellence if
                    every
                    essay is of the same quality. That leads to a sea of mediocrity. My writing is NOT mediocre, but
                    compared to the omniscience abilities of ChatGPT, my verisimilitude will be punished.

                <h2>Thursday, 17th October</h2>
                <p>
                    Life unfolds in chapters, each one offering a chance for change, growth, and sometimes, an
                    unexpected
                    shift in the narrative. Just as a story builds with each new scene, so does the character of a
                    person—moulded by moments of challenge, introspection, and the subtle pressures that shape our
                    responses
                    to the world. We begin as one version of ourselves, clinging to familiar roles, but life has a way
                    of
                    pushing us into new acts, whether we are ready or not. These turning points, often disguised as
                    ordinary
                    days, reveal how far we've come from the people we once were, and hint at the potential of who we
                    might
                    become.
                    <br><br>
                    In the last three years alone, I have left home, started university, conquered my fear of flying,
                    and
                    lived in a foreign country. The list of fears and anxieties that had plagued me for so long has
                    diminished with every passing year, leaving only one solitary fear left. Though I am not free of
                    this
                    burden, I understand the importance of acknowledging this vast journey—recognising the introvert I
                    was
                    and the person I’ve become. Today, on an ordinary day like any other, an opportunity presented
                    itself in
                    the form of a careers event hosted by JLR (Jaguar Land Rover), offering a chance to reflect on this
                    transformation.
                    <br><br>
                    The event began with an informal Q&A designed to inspire, as the tagline suggested, but
                    unfortunately,
                    it quickly gave way to a sense of ennui. Alas, although some parts were informative and interesting,
                    the
                    hour-long advertisement for the company felt unnecessarily prolonged and could have been shortened
                    to a
                    succinct fifteen-minute presentation.. The following two hours was a coalition of tasks and
                    exercises
                    which were part of JLR’s employment process to give us short tasters on the joys to expect if we
                    apply
                    for entry level/graduate roles.
                    <br><br>
                    We were divided into three groups, rotating through the different tasks. Curiously, the majority of
                    my
                    peers hailed from Cyber Security rather than Software Development or Computer Science, which was
                    odd,
                    given that none of the available graduate programmes catered to their background. The exercises were
                    largely focused on soft skills—the kind that are crucial in most professions—though each task was
                    modelled after real components from JLR’s past application processes.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the tasks required us to give a ten-minute presentation as a team, focusing on the future of
                    electric vehicles and what innovations we could bring to JLR. As is typical in situations where
                    strangers are forced to collaborate, everyone initially avoided eye contact, busied themselves with
                    their phones, and waited for someone else to take the lead. I can’t stand these moments; it would be
                    so
                    much easier if everyone just communicated openly and tackled the task head-on. Assuming the role of
                    project manager, I spearheaded the conversation into a productive discussion. Eventually, we settled
                    on
                    a few safe, pragmatic ideas—concepts that other luxury brands had already implemented, ensuring we
                    wouldn’t stray too far from familiar territory.
                    <br><br>
                    Delivering these ideas with a sense of confidence and ease is a skill that many lack, often because
                    it’s
                    simply not emphasised in public schools. This is one reason why so many politicians and CEOs thrive
                    in
                    their fields—class and background play a significant role. The basics of clear speech and proper
                    enunciation are foundational to public speaking, but my team struggled with these. Hearing our ideas
                    relayed in a monotone mumble felt almost painful, lacking the energy and conviction that a strong
                    pitch
                    requires.
                    <br><br>
                    Then it was my turn. I could liken myself to Thomas Skinner in the delivery of my pitch, but I’ll
                    refrain. The task was meant to simulate a direct pitch to JLR departments, but I treated it like a
                    sales
                    opportunity, crafting my delivery to convey the lifestyle and essence of a Jaguar owner. I
                    emphasised
                    the opulence and class associated with the brand, painting a vivid picture for the audience before
                    seamlessly tying it back to user experience and the comfort of Jaguar’s electric vehicles. It was
                    beautiful. Smooth, confident, engaging. I couldn’t have done it any better if I had tried.
                    <br><br>
                    After my performance in the presentation and spearheading the discussions on the subsequent tasks, I
                    was
                    approached by Nuri, a representative of JLR, to gauge my interest in the graduate schemes.
                    Explaining
                    that I was an aspiring Software Developer, he lamented explaining the difficulties of achieving that
                    role without a masters degree. He went on to expound the perks and benefits of working in project
                    management. He emphasised how my strengths—generating ideas, steering discussions, and creating a
                    positive atmosphere—would serve me well in that field, and his feedback gave me pause to reflect on
                    skills I hadn’t fully recognised in myself before.
                    <br><br>
                    Mmm, interesting. Before today, I was ignorant that I possessed this specific skill set so my
                    sceptical
                    demeanour is telling me that I must have just been with some extremely laconic people for these
                    tasks
                    instead of being an exceptional leader. But perhaps there’s more to this than I initially
                    thought—maybe
                    I’ve been underestimating my potential in areas outside of software development.
                    <br><br>
                    Irrespective of this positive introspection, I think it is beneficial to acknowledge what I’ve
                    learnt,
                    not just about the careers available but that I have grown as a person. Despite my reservations of
                    the
                    successes of my Erasmus year, my implicit assimilation of these soft skills has been put to the test
                    this afternoon and I have surprised myself at my capabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    It was clear that I was no longer the passive participant I once was. Instead, I had become someone
                    who
                    could navigate the complexities of group dynamics, articulate thoughts under pressure, and most
                    surprisingly, bring out the best in those around me. The introverted neophyte, the part I was once
                    so
                    comfortable to play, has outgrown me, making way to a new character. The start of a new Act. May
                    tomorrow yield the same bright torch as today.

                    My neck is better which is fortunate because I have the Racing team meeting and the Demon Media
                    Magazine
                    workshops today. Both were semi-introductory events with the Racing society proving to be more
                    popular
                    on the day. There are two meetings, I’ve since found out. One for the casual learners like myself,
                    and a
                    dedicated meeting for the mechanical engineers who are obliged to partake in the workshop elements
                    as
                    part of their final year project. The team leader is as stereotypical as you might think with
                    sponsored
                    polo shirts and a brummie accent. He can’t be much older than me which undermines his authority in
                    the
                    workshop.
                    <br><br>
                    Demon media magazine was a short and succinct session outlining the format of the latest edition and
                    the
                    scheduling around it. We are working towards the Winter edition which is due to be released in early
                    December. The categories are open ended meaning we can write about almost anything and they will
                    publish. This laissez-faire attitude is what makes the previous releases seem disjointed and
                    unprofessional. Pick a niche and dedicate the magazine to it instead of mixing a creative writing
                    publication with a political satire overview. Personally, it doesn’t make sense to me but it’s not
                    my
                    place to dictate over. The elections for editor-in-chief are due to be held next week and as tempted
                    as
                    I am to nominate myself, I am not looking for another obligation to dedicate my time to. I can still
                    make a difference by producing quality articles as and when I want.

                    The shunt last night affected me more than I initially thought. I woke up this morning unable to
                    turn my
                    head, and I have to keep everything straight to ease the pain. A couple of friends from the racing
                    society came over to check on me (since, after the track doctor gave me the all-clear last night,
                    why
                    not get a second opinion from more ersatz medical professionals too?). They think it's probably a
                    bad
                    sprain, but if I still can't turn my head by this time tomorrow, I'll see an actual doctor instead
                    of
                    relying on these self-proclaimed ones. The only way I can turn is by moving my entire body which
                    makes
                    me look like a life-sized marionette. On a more optimistic note, I have devoted the day to coding,
                    which
                    has put me a few lectures ahead so every cloud has a silver lining I guess.

                    Let’s Go Karting! The highly anticipated taster session took place this evening, with slots
                    allocated on
                    a first-come-first-served basis to the first thirty individuals who checked the Karting group chat
                    this
                    morning. That’s right—last-minute planning and a limited number of spaces. Pilates would have to be
                    postponed for yet another week.
                    <br><br>
                    The main draw? Everything was complimentary thanks to DMU Sport. I’d been eager to return to the
                    track
                    ever since rekindling my interest in F1 back in 2022, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.
                    I
                    donned my brand-new Adidas trainers, intent on breaking them in, but almost immediately upon
                    stepping
                    off the bus at the circuit, a kart whizzed by, splattering mud all over them. “Gives them
                    character,”
                    was the circuit manager’s attempt at sarcasm. I wanted to wind him...
                    <br><br>
                    Of the thirty participants, ten belonged to the Karting society, and twelve had recently been
                    karting
                    within the past year. I found myself among the minority of novices who had never been Karting
                    before.
                    The event began with three practice sessions, each accommodating ten drivers and allowing us fifteen
                    minutes to familiarise ourselves with the track and record our best time. That time would dictate
                    our
                    starting positions in the subsequent heats.
                    <br><br>
                    I was testing out my tires, checking my grip level, sticking to the racing line, before actually
                    attempting a flying lap. Meanwhile, there were drivers going off at every corner. Powersliding round
                    the
                    bends, rearranging the cones to the pit wall. It was pandemonium. The marshals lining the track
                    offered
                    little more than feeble warnings, holding up signs that read Calm Down and Be Careful. What is this,
                    a
                    token gesture to deflect liability in case we end up decapitating ourselves?
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t long after till I had my first shunt. A Verstappen wannabe dive bombed up the inside,
                    looking
                    for a gap that clearly wasn’t there. He left the braking too late and drove straight into me.
                    Thankfully, these kart can only reach 40mph otherwise I might have been in trouble. After a stern
                    look
                    from the marshall and a yellow flag, we carried on with the qualifying session.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite not having driven a kart in over a decade, I managed to secure third place in my qualifying
                    session with a respectable 47.3 seconds. For context, the society chair—a seasoned amateur—was
                    clocking
                    in at 41.5 seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    The race itself was as adrenaline-fueled as I had hoped. My qualifying time placed me third in the
                    second heat—essentially the second group of ten. It was a rolling start, so we missed out on the
                    exhilaration of lining up on the grid and watching the lights go out. Nevertheless, after a swift
                    exit
                    from the pits, I began closing in on the kart ahead. Biding my time for the first few laps, I inched
                    closer and closer. Approaching the last corner, I decided to make a move up the inside.
                    Unfortunately,
                    my assigned kart lacked the same grip as the one I used during qualifying. I spun out, ending up
                    facing
                    the wrong direction on the track. The gap between me and the racers behind wasn’t as comfortable as
                    I’d
                    assumed—two karts barreled into me, sending me careening off the track entirely. Red flags waved,
                    and we
                    were all sent back to the pits.
                    <br><br>
                    Though I felt fine, I had to undergo a medical assessment for potential whiplash since this crash
                    was
                    much more egregious than my first altercation in the practice. After a brief convalescence and a
                    thumbs-up from the ersatz doctor on site, I was cleared to return to the track. Yet, as I sit here
                    writing this, my neck throbs with the lingering aftermath.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite my injury, I did manage to make that move on the pole sitter, claiming victory in my heat. I
                    am
                    much too honourable to brag, but I must admit I felt a surge of gratification. Unfortunately, this
                    will
                    be a one-off appearance for me, as the society membership costs £40, and I’m tighter than a drum
                    when it
                    comes to spending. Cough cough. The socials will still be available as I’ve been looking forward to
                    having simpatico people to share F1 views with. Unfortunately, it looks like a great number of these
                    people are Verstappen and Red Bull fans. Looks like the socials won’t be as congenial as I first
                    thought.

                <h2>Sunday, 13th October</h2>
                <p>
                    The day after departing London is always a depressing one. From getting a taste of where I could be
                    to
                    the realisation of where I am. Only eight more months in Leicester before I’m hopefully off to do
                    better
                    things.
                    <br><br>
                    I have been in St Martins House for three weeks now, and it seems like the ‘honeymoon period’ has
                    worn
                    off. The cleanliness of the kitchen has somewhat deteriorated since I’ve been away. The stove is
                    covered
                    in dried food, crumbs have been left covering the worktops, the floor is sticky with God knows what,
                    and
                    the sink is about to be clogged with the amount of food left in the drain. I’m about ready to start
                    knocking on doors and cracking the whip, but in an effort to maintain the equilibrium of the flat, I
                    tidied it up myself. <em>Just this once.</em> Of course, I’m not a fool—I’ve left a sarcastic note
                    on
                    the
                    worktops detailing my hard labour. They can interpret it however they like.
                    <br><br>
                    Sorting the hundreds of photos from the past few days is a time-consuming job, as many are similar
                    but
                    focus on different vantage points. It’s difficult to see which are considered good and which are
                    mediocre from a non-biased position since I’m the photographer. My artistic chauvinism insists that
                    they
                    are all masterpieces, so I’m getting Natalia and Emily to have a look at them when I see them next.
                    God,
                    is that the type of person I am? <em>“Everyone gather round whilst I show you slides of my
                    holidays.”</em>How
                    hubristic is that! Regardless, it’ll be good to get their opinions.

                <p>
                    Ironically, my best night’s sleep since moving back to University has been in Liam’s bed. I think
                    that
                    is the message I’ve been waiting for to invest in further padding for my springboard for a mattress
                    I’ve
                    got currently.
                    <br><br>
                    My plan was to head swiftly to the British Museum this morning since I like to update myself on the
                    exhibitions at least once a year. Since my Erasmus year in Stockholm, it’s been almost two since I
                    last
                    visited. After a late one last night, time was against me. My train was departing at half two so
                    instead
                    of rushing round the museum, I opted for a photoshoot of Marble Arch instead. Again putting my
                    photography skills to the test until it was time to go.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s been another successful outing to London: two shows, a Globe Theatre tour, an F1 exhibition, a
                    plethora of photos and a long-overdue catchup with Matthew. Until we meet again, London, may the
                    distance be brief and my return quick upon the wind.

                <h2>Friday, 11th October</h2>
                <p>
                    After a free trip on the DLR—thanks to my confusion about where to scan my card—I arrived at the
                    ExCeL
                    Centre in East London for the Formula One exhibition. Usually, when visiting London, I stay within a
                    central area—roughly bounded by St Pancras, Mile End, the Globe Theatre, and Hyde Park. This time,
                    though, I ventured further, and East London didn’t disappoint. The area is beautiful, with stunning
                    views, especially from the Royal Victoria Dock footbridge, which offers a spectacular vantage point
                    of
                    the Canary Wharf skyline.
                    <br><br>
                    The F1 exhibition was well-curated, guiding visitors through a maze of attractions with provided
                    headphones. It delved into the sport's rich history, highlighting Bernie Ecclestone's pivotal role
                    in
                    making it an international phenomenon, as well as celebrating the successes of legendary drivers
                    like
                    Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher, and Lewis Hamilton. The exhibition also
                    covered important safety advancements, including the introduction of crash barriers and the halo.
                    Among
                    the F1 cars on display were the RB16—not Verstappen’s record-breaking RB19 from last season—and the
                    2020
                    Mercedes. One particularly striking exhibit was the charred remains of Romain Grosjean’s car from
                    his
                    harrowing 2020 crash; it's a sobering sight, but a powerful reminder of how fortunate he was to
                    survive.
                    <br><br>
                    Around the venue, screens featured interviews with key figures discussing car design, engineering,
                    and
                    famous rivalries between drivers and teams. For £30, the experience felt like good value, offering
                    plenty of insight into the world of Formula One.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, the exhibition ended with a gift shop. I hoped to find a Mercedes Team hoodie—its colours
                    more subtle than the bold orange McLaren one I had returned yesterday—but the prices were
                    eye-watering.
                    £15 for a keyring, £45 for caps, and a staggering £130 for hoodies. I wasn’t the only one taken
                    aback;
                    murmurs of incredulity echoed among the other visitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Resisting any impulse purchases, I left quickly and made my way to the Globe Theatre for a guided
                    tour.
                    London's transport system is truly one of its best features—being able to travel ten miles from East
                    London to London Bridge for a reasonable fare is a major advantage. It’s just a shame that the
                    railways
                    don’t share this kind of accessible pricing.
                    <br><br>
                    Arriving a little earlier than expected, I was able to take a peek inside Tate Modern. I wish I
                    could
                    say that this was a refreshing change from my go-to art venue of the National Gallery, but the
                    abstractionism on display bordered on frivolous and arid. Tate Modern focuses on modern art from the
                    past century. This makes it ambiguous to define given it’s hard to discern what this epoch will be
                    remembered for in a few hundred years time. The Neoclassicism of the 1700s is as unique and separate
                    from the Romanticism and Realism of the 1800s. I only hope that the large canvas of painted stripes
                    does
                    not go down as century defining work.
                    <br><br>
                    It got me thinking what is the purpose of Art. Should it be conformist, contentious, byzantine? The
                    exhibition I saw was about celebrating the monotony of everyday life. That’s why it included many
                    photos
                    of household items, populated streets, and shop windows. This would be a captivating collection had
                    it
                    been in any other location but London.
                    <br><br>
                    It raises the question: does art exist to highlight what we overlook, or is it meant to transcend
                    the
                    ordinary? An exhibition like this could be fascinating in a more remote, serene setting, where the
                    everyday life on display might contrast sharply with the viewer’s experience of the surroundings.
                    But in
                    London, it risks becoming part of the noise, a reflection of what’s already outside the gallery
                    walls.
                    <br><br>
                    In that sense, art’s purpose becomes layered: it can be conformist, capturing and celebrating life
                    as it
                    is, contentious, challenging our assumptions and provoking thought, or byzantine, complex and
                    difficult
                    to unravel. But perhaps, like this exhibition, it can also be a mirror, inviting us to see the
                    overlooked beauty or dullness in our own routines—turning the ordinary into something worth
                    contemplating.
                    <br><br>
                    Damn it. I wasn’t that impressed with the art but the fact that it has garnered this level of
                    analysis,
                    answers my question of the purpose of the art on display.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto more impressive sights. The Globe Theatre tour was as magical as expected. The afternoon
                    matinee
                    performance of The Comedy of Errors had just concluded which meant the team were dismantling the set
                    to
                    prepare for the evening show of Hansel & Gretel. The guide was an all access pass to the Globe,
                    teaching
                    us about the history and the architecture which makes the plays come to life. This is the third
                    Globe
                    Theatre; only opening in 1997. The project was spearheaded by Sam Wanamaker who was an actor and
                    director, but mainly a Shakespeare aficionado. Wanamaker accumulated the funds from wealthy
                    supporters
                    and benefactors and immortalised their largesse by engraving their names in the concrete slabs
                    outside
                    the Theatre. Some notable names include Lawrence Olivier, Alfred Hitchcock, Maggie Smith, Dame Judi
                    Dench, and Kenneth Branagh. Wanamaker was quite ingenuitive. He went down the phone book and called
                    everyone with the surname of Shakespeare asking for donations. Unsurprisingly, most supported the
                    cause
                    as it meant they could be a part of history.
                    <br><br>
                    Taking a break from my cultural activities, it was time for pool and a catchup with Matthew. The
                    mechanics which I learnt from snooker served me well. This is how I expected the Pool Tournament to
                    go
                    during freshers but was instead greeted with bent cues and unsportsmanlike behaviour from my
                    opponent.
                    After a bite to eat, Matthew gave me a tour around the Barbican and then we hit the pubs. I say this
                    everytime I visit London but the people who live there don’t realise how lucky they are to have
                    everything right on their doorstep. Culture, musicals, plays, tourist attractions, architecture,
                    palaces, parks, skyscrapers, castles, and Shakespeare. It’s probably best that I don’t live there
                    yet,
                    otherwise I would bankrupt myself by seeing every play under the sun.

                <h2>Thursday, 10th October</h2>
                <p>
                    After my indulgent spending spree on Tuesday night (yes, that blog was an allegory about my reckless
                    shopping), today brought the stark realisation that my dilemma lies in want, not need. While some
                    purchases were necessities, the more extravagant ones—the McLaren F1 hoodie, the Levi's jeans—were
                    better returned. My frugal instincts, once again, saved me from myself. Yet, there’s nothing more
                    déclassé than walking back into the stores where, just days earlier, I had proudly parted with a
                    large
                    chunk of my net worth, only to ask for refunds. I could feel the judgement in the cashier's eyes.
                    <br><br>
                    One particularly irksome trend emerged: the disappearance of the physical card swipe in the refund
                    process. At each store, they processed the refund remotely, without me even tapping my card.
                    Unacceptable! I want visual confirmation! Either the reassuring beep or preferably dollar signs
                    floating
                    through the air! The clear sign that my money is being returned. Instead, I’m met with the
                    assurances of
                    the cashier who has no obligation to spare me from their mendacity. “Your refund will be back in
                    your
                    account in three to five days.” Will it? I suppose I have no choice but to trust you then.
                    <br><br>
                    Putting this behind me, it was time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Leicester. Hello the bright
                    lights
                    of London. First on the agenda: SIX! The Musical. Immediately, time was against me as I rushed to
                    the
                    Vaudeville Theatre as the train was inevitably delayed. The musical was about the six ex-wives of
                    Henry
                    VIII and offered a refreshing format when compared to other musicals. Instead of telling a story,
                    reliving their lives, it was similar to a concert with each character trying to persuade the
                    audience
                    that they were the most memorable wife. Complete with audience interaction and individual solos, I
                    would
                    recommend it to everyone. I thought the short runtime would hinder it but instead it enriches
                    everything, giving it a brisk pace that keeps everyone engaged and entertained from start to finish.
                    Each performance is a burst of energy, drawing you in with catchy tunes and clever lyrics. Similar
                    to
                    Hamilton, its purpose is to teach children about history whilst incorporating modern references;
                    joking
                    about the patriarchy and commenting on the male hegemony of today. It is critically well received
                    for
                    these reasons as well as passing the Bechdel test which most musicals tend to fail.*

                    After a brief photography session with my new zoom lens, capturing the London skyline between the
                    Vaudeville Theatre and the Globe Theatre, I transitioned from reliving the embellished history of
                    Henry
                    VIII in the early sixteenth century to exploring the world of Shakespeare in the late sixteenth
                    century.
                    Liam was just as ebullient to be spending a night watching Shakespeare, which he showed by heading
                    straight to the bar to indulge in red wine before we took our seats. The Comedy of Errors, a classic
                    tale of mistaken identity, intrigue, and the complexities of love… the paragon of Shakespearean
                    Literature. It’s about two sets of identical twins who are separated at birth and accidentally
                    reunited
                    through a series of fortunate circumstances. The ensuing chaos leads to comedic situations, wrongful
                    accusations, and of course, a joyful reunion. This certainly wasn’t a tragedy.
                    <br><br>
                    The Globe wasn’t sold out but still boasted a good turnout for a cold October evening. When I go
                    again
                    in the future, I will be sure to put extra layers on. Tonight, Liam graciously supplied me with a
                    woolly
                    jumper as I was expecting the same warm temperatures I was enjoying in Leicester but ended up
                    freezing
                    instead. Two hours of laughs, shenanigans and tomfoolery, the players took their final bow and it
                    was
                    time to go. Time to have a rough night’s sleep on Liam’s floor.

                <p>
                    Soar Point was buzzing as ever. The raucous thrills of students from all faculties, enjoying the
                    camaraderie of their respective societies. The Women's Champions League games, which garnered a
                    larger
                    crowd than I would have expected in a student bar, were displayed on every screen. Each table was
                    lined
                    with benches and discounted menus to accommodate the extra influx of customers. Personally, I don’t
                    know
                    much about Women’s football. The runners who I was with, shared a passing interest but their
                    enthusiasm
                    wavered once the conversation moved off Lionesses Euro Campaign. While it was a successful night for
                    Manchester City who won against Barcelona, Arsenal didn’t share the same glory, being huminited 5-2.
                    When the fourth goal went in, that’s when the uproar started. A group of supporters couldn’t contain
                    their disappointment and as one would expect from a footballing crowd, unleashed a diatribe of abuse
                    at
                    the screens. It was no different from what can be heard at a men’s game but because it was Women’s
                    football and the pub was filled with students, many disapproved of the misogynistic epithets. Still,
                    I
                    didn’t think it was anything egregious so continued my conversation with the runners. Five minutes
                    later, the fans were being escorted out of the pub; followed by the owner’s statement, apologising
                    for
                    an offence which people might have suffered. I was in disbelief. I guess that’s the level we’re at
                    here.
                    I best not bring out my best Bernard Manning impressions or Jimmy Carr jokes. Soft tarts.

                <h2>Tuesday, 8th October</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me tell you a story. It’s about a man; tall, debonair, a true gentleman with a penchant for fine
                    things. He carried himself with the grace of nobility, believing firmly that a man’s mood and
                    fortune
                    were shaped, in no small part, by how he presented himself to the world. His garments, he believed,
                    were
                    a reflection of his spirit, and so he took great care to adorn himself in the finest cloth that gold
                    could buy.
                    <br><br>
                    This man, though refined and prudent in most affairs, was not immune to the whims of vanity, and the
                    allure of luxury tugged often at his heart. One evening, word reached him of a rare event—a grand
                    market, closed to the commoners, where only those of youthful vigour and standing might enter. It
                    was
                    whispered that the best merchants of the realm would offer their goods at prices so low, they defied
                    reason. A nobleman's wardrobe for a tradesman’s coin.
                    <br><br>
                    To make the market more tempting for these young souls, the guilds set forth amusements to capture
                    their
                    fancies. There was music, lively as a royal ball, played by minstrels who stood high on a dais in
                    the
                    midst of the square. Brightly coloured pennants flapped in the evening air, strewn across the market
                    stalls like the banners of a noble tournament. It was like a merry festival, yet strange, for no
                    guiding
                    hand of elder or master was there to rein in the wild spirit of youth. For but two hours, these
                    apprentices had free reign to barter, trade, and snatch up the finest wares at unheard-of discounts,
                    as
                    if time itself had been turned to favour them.
                    <br><br>
                    Into this revelry strode our protagonist; a man no different from his peers, eyes wide at the
                    splendour
                    and goods displayed before him. He had no thought of thrift or restraint, for such a night comes but
                    seldom, and never again might such bargains be offered. So, as though possessed by a strange frenzy,
                    he
                    dashed from one stall to the next, his purse jingling with the coin he had saved.
                    <br><br>
                    He purchased fine woollen breeches, velvet doublets fit for a nobleman, a grand leather jerkin, and
                    even
                    a hooded cloak emblazoned with the crest of a famous knightly order. Each piece he bought with
                    little
                    thought, for the prices, they said, were far lower than any would find on a common market day. And
                    so,
                    laden with goods, he strode back to his quarters, a triumphant smile upon his face.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, as the moon rose higher in the sky, and the frenzy of the fair faded, the young man sat amidst
                    his
                    newly acquired riches and began to reckon his coin. He gazed in his reflection; in awe at his
                    sartorial
                    elegance for it was then that a troubling thought took root. He had spent far more than he had ever
                    intended. What use had he for so many fine garments? Could he truly afford to keep all that he had
                    purchased? And indeed, did he even need such luxuries, when simpler wares might serve him just as
                    well?
                    <br><br>
                    And thus, my friends, this tale stands as a caution to all. For even the sharpest mind can be dulled
                    by
                    the glitter of a fleeting bargain, and in the rush to seize every treasure, one may return home
                    burdened
                    with far more than they need—or can pay for. Better to be the one who walks the fair with a
                    discerning
                    eye and a steady hand, rather than the one who staggers away with empty pockets and full regrets.
                    After
                    all, it’s not the abundance of fine things that brings satisfaction, but the wisdom to leave behind
                    what
                    you never truly needed.
                    <br><br>
                    Hopefully, you can deduce the allegory behind that story. I’m sure the more perceptive folk will
                    pick up
                    on the deeper meaning. Or perhaps, much like the man in the story, you’ve been swept up in my fine
                    words
                    and now find yourself sitting there wondering, "Wait… what was the point again?" But fear not—unlike
                    the
                    man, at least you didn’t spend anything and it was only time you wasted!

                <p>
                    Waking up at five in the morning does not do anything to improve my productivity for the day. If
                    anything, it stymies motivation. I struggle to sleep because of a number of factors. One: my mind is
                    too
                    active with developing mobile apps. I’m thinking of all the opportunities which become available
                    once I
                    complete this module. Two: my duvet is two thick for these warm autumn evenings. Opening my window
                    is
                    not an option to counteract this because the incessant sirens are insufferable. Three: my mattress
                    is
                    springy - and not in a good way. Four: There are too many things happening at the moment for me to
                    get
                    an early night anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    So what do I do if I can’t comfortably get back to sleep? Well, I start reading, which is futile
                    because
                    I haven’t had enough REM sleep which means the part of the brain which consolidates memory is not
                    working efficiently. Thus when I awake a few hours later, I will have forgotten the pages I’ve
                    covered.
                    Option two is to persist in trying to sleep which is rarely successful. Lastly, I will start coding.
                    This normally means I’ve given up on sleep and am ready to start the day… at five in the morning.
                    Call
                    it productive or an auspicious start to the day. It takes its toll on me when it comes to the
                    evening
                    activities when I am struggling to keep my eyes open. I have sacrificed running with the group
                    tonight
                    and cancelled my place in Pilates. All because I am sleep deprived. I need to do something to fix
                    this.

                    Bollocks. I’ve made the Futsal team. After my poor performance during the trials on Friday night, I
                    thought it would be a long shot to assume that I’ll be selected. Obviously, the coach had a few
                    laudatory voices chirping in his ear convincing him that I’m worth the gamble. As previously
                    mentioned,
                    I have a busy schedule with all the other activities and societies I want to be involved in.
                    Ideally,
                    futsal would just be a social event where I could pick and choose the sessions which I wanted to
                    attend.
                    This news certainly has complicated a few things. There is no rush to decide as I don’t need to pay
                    the
                    sign-up fee for a few weeks, therefore my plan is to stick to my timetable prioritising Hackers and
                    Demon Media and see how many free evenings I can spare after those commitments. Futsal doesn’t
                    embellish
                    my CV which is why it’s third in my pecking order. Irrespective of my dilemma, I am honoured to be
                    selected; knowing that my skill is being recognised.

                    What brings together, transgender people, ex-drug addicts, insomniacs, non-binaries, and
                    schizophrenia
                    patients. That’s right. The Media society. The home to the society outcasts basking in solitude.
                    Everyone as uniquely protuberant as the next. These people have taken the time out of their day,
                    exited
                    their caves, to grace us with their presence to join the new intake of Demon Media. “Write what you
                    know,” was the advice the current editor-in-chief told us. Hardly a niche magazine then but if the
                    possibilities are endless with little moderation or censorship, this magazine is going to be a mix
                    between Orwell’s ‘nineteen eighty-four’ and Freud’s ‘The Psychopathology of Everyday Life’. Out of
                    the
                    three strands of Media, I am focusing on Radio and the Magazine. Enough to learn new skills but not
                    dominate all of my time.
                    <br><br>
                    For the record, that’s Futsal, Running, Karting, Hackers, Demon Media, Racing and Pilates all
                    happening
                    alongside my studies. There are also cultural exchange classes which look appealing which run from
                    November to March which serve as a good additional qualification to complete after my Erasmus year.
                    With
                    all of these extra curriculars, it will be impossible to keep up to date with everything so some
                    will
                    have to be demoted to occasional outings. Competitive futsal is looking less and less likely since I
                    have access to free sessions when I have time anyway at the Watershed. The trial this evening went
                    poorly too so I’ll see if I even make the team. At the end, I was still asked what my number was so
                    there may be hope yet. I think I’m being picked from reputation alone. After gaining the nickname
                    ‘Cold
                    Palmer’ by the players already on the team, it’s evident I showed some skill in previous sessions to
                    gain such a reputable moniker.
                    <br><br>
                    Irrespective of the outcome this evening, Monday evenings are also reserved for Pilates. It’s four
                    days
                    on and I can still feel my abs flaring up when I sit up in the morning. Karting will likely take a
                    back
                    seat too; partly because it’s expensive to participate and very time consuming. I can still take
                    part in
                    the society socials at Soar point to watch the F1 races on the weekend which I’m fervently waiting
                    for.
                    <br><br>
                    PS. The camera lens which I bought off ebay on Wednesday evening arrived five days earlier than
                    expected. First inspections have revealed no conspicuous faults but we’ll see when I go for my first
                    photography session this weekend. Everything seems to be falling into place auspiciously.

                    Bit of a disconcerting atmosphere in the building today. Similar to a heavy pall lingering over a
                    city.
                    It started off as a normal day; all was well. That was until a resident overdosed in the common
                    room. I
                    don’t know the symptoms of an overdose or what one looks like outside of the flicks, but from the
                    detailed descriptions I got from my friends on the ground floor, it sounds similar to a seizure. I’m
                    not
                    sure who was with her at the time or what was taken, but by this evening, the Rashomon effect had
                    truly
                    taken hold, and I was hearing all forms of speculation. Was she suicidal? Was it a cry for help? Was
                    she
                    spiked? Was it an accident? From the tales I’ve heard today, it’s similar to a creative writing
                    assignment I did in Stockholm where we were given the end of a short story and we needed to write
                    the
                    beginning. Each story is different, with complex characters and embellished storylines. The only
                    definitive fact I know is that someone overdosed. Current status unknown. End of.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto a lighter topic. On my perpetual quest for social interaction this year, I had another society
                    gathering this evening: DMU Hackers. The one I’ve been most anticipating. Relevant to Comp. Science
                    by
                    association, though not directly included in my course modules. Dilan was genuinely pleased to see
                    me
                    when I stepped out of the elevator. I think a friendly face was all he needed since he was running
                    the
                    society this year. Given his extensive knowledge in Cyber Security, he is more than qualified. In
                    addition to the culmination of his placement year at IBM, he could pass for a lecturer now. I won’t
                    bore
                    you with the ins and outs of the meeting, but it was great fun, and I regret not participating in
                    previous years. If only I were more confident…
                    <br><br>
                    We concluded the meeting with a visit to Soar Point, the campus sports bar, which I am starting to
                    become a frequent visitor through the different societies. Mehmet, Natalia’s boyfriend, was there
                    with a
                    few of his engineering friends who he introduced me to. Some I already had the pleasure of speaking
                    with
                    at the DMU Racing brief. These are the lads who will hopefully be teaching me how to build an
                    engine. I
                    just need to manage my time effectively so I have enough bandwidth to take part in all these
                    extracurriculars. My current thought process is omitting Futsal from my schedule and only doing a
                    session a week instead of the competitive league for which I have been scouted. The trial is
                    tomorrow
                    evening, so I’ll update you on how that plans out. Though the first Demon Media society meeting
                    starts
                    at six, so I’ll have to think of a crafty excuse to account for my premature exit. See what I mean
                    about
                    my busy schedule…

                    I’m a thief. Well, actually, a fraudster would be a more accurate description. Remember those Asics
                    running trainers which were half a size too big? Well, after a five-minute cleanup job and a steady
                    hand
                    attaching the tags again, I have managed to fool the Sports Direct staff into thinking they were
                    unworn.
                    That’s right—a pair of running trainers which I ran 5k in while it rained, plus an active Pilates
                    session straight afterward, and I’ve exchanged them for a pair which is half a size smaller. I
                    almost
                    feel guilty, but my acuity towards subterfuge is to be admired.
                    <br><br>
                    Onto my academic endeavors for the day. After the unchallenging lecture and practical session
                    yesterday,
                    and consultation with Dillan, I have persuaded my course leader to allow me to switch to Mobile App
                    Development. Therefore, I am not repeating the same module which I completed in second year. Also,
                    this
                    means I get to have classes with Dilan, which is always a huge benefit. Why not just stick to Big
                    Data
                    and Machine Learning since you’ve already got the finished coursework, I hear you ask? Well, even
                    though
                    I achieved a first in the module last time out, I actually want to learn a new programming language
                    and
                    get a modicum of experience in the mobile development industry. To be honest, I despised operating
                    the
                    infrastructure which DMU employed to handle Big Data databases, so I didn’t want to put myself
                    through
                    that again. Also, the Kotlin programming language is so intuitive; I practically already know it
                    from
                    learning its derivatives.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long-anticipated wait, Jimmy Carr has finally come to Leicester. We managed to snag tickets
                    for
                    the half-nine showing—me, Natalia, and Natalia’s boyfriend, Mehmet, who happens to be a really nice
                    guy.
                    The show was as expected, with insults, heckles, and banter. Very funny. The audience participation
                    is a
                    must because I felt like snappy one-liners get tiresome after a while. The spontaneity of the
                    audience
                    is what makes it unique. Though there were a lot of jokes which I have seen him perform before on
                    YouTube, etc. When the audience shouts a heckle relating to his tax affairs, he has the same
                    choreographed routine to defend himself. Also, rehearsed clapbacks when asked about Trump, Biden,
                    Starmer, Epstein... I heard him do one joke which I first heard him perform on an episode of <em>Eight
                    Out
                    of Ten Cats</em> in 2019. Nevertheless, it was a great evening, and I would recommend everyone go to
                    watch
                    him at least once.

                    The society group chats have been in full swing today. The Racing Society has been talking about F1
                    for
                    six hours now—and I love it. There are around seventy members, each with a fervent opinion about the
                    status quo in the driver championship. I occasionally throw in an obviously contentious point of
                    view
                    just to rattle a few people. I know—I’m a prick. I am also part of the Running group chat, which is
                    home
                    dominantly to last night’s joggers complaining about their aches and pains. I’m in the same boat as
                    them, but I’m stoic and don’t publicly announce my weaknesses.
                    <br><br>
                    A dark horse society which I’ve joined is the Doctor Who Society. There are only a handful of us in
                    the
                    group chat, so I don’t know what level of participation I am going to achieve. Call me
                    old-fashioned,
                    but 40% of the members identify as ‘they,’ and they have already given me negative first
                    impressions—either from their kowtowing to other group members to hammer home their pronouns or
                    their
                    Calvinistic approach to running a society. A personal pet peeve of mine, and I know it’s nitpicky:
                    people who don’t use proper grammar or spelling when texting. I don’t mind abbreviations, but
                    individuals who say ‘I fought’ instead of ‘I thought’ are clearly Satanists. That is a speech
                    impediment; therefore, they have no excuse to extend that poor vocabulary into the medium of text.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving away from societies, I had my first timetabled lecture and practical today. Having made my
                    notes
                    yesterday, this introductory session was nothing strenuous. The first Big Data and Machine Learning
                    lecture was no hardship. The most discerning thing I learned is that out of a class of approximately
                    one
                    hundred students, 71% had never used the Python programming language. These are Computer Science
                    students! As I have already done two Big Data modules (one at DMU in second year and one in
                    Stockholm),
                    I should be an expert at machine learning algorithms. I must not get complacent; I must not get
                    complacent; I must not get complacent.

                    The biggest hardship I faced this morning, technologically speaking, is trying to get my Linux
                    laptop
                    connected to the DMU WiFi. After thirty minutes debugging myself and a further thirty-five minutes
                    with
                    a crestfallen IT officer in the library, I finally connected. I am the first student he has helped
                    who
                    has faced this problem in thirteen years. Speaking on the phone to the IT staff in Gateway House, he
                    was
                    elucidating the need for updated documentation so these problems don’t reoccur. Also, in that
                    conversation, I was referred to as ‘a gentleman of discernment and taste’ when it comes to operating
                    systems.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I’m off to the DSU to participate in the pièce de résistance of my fresher's journey—the event
                    which
                    I have been preparing for since March: the pool tournament.

                <p>
                    The DMU Global trips have been released. During my time here at university, I have made the most of
                    these trips—first going to Bilbao and then spending a year in Stockholm. This year is my final year,
                    so
                    I obviously don’t want anything to clash; however, it looks like the majority of trips are happening
                    during the first week of Easter, which is convenient. There are a few that have caught my eye:
                    Berlin,
                    Salzburg, Dublin. Unfortunately, they are not available to my faculty. There are several trips in
                    the
                    extracurricular category which are applicable to me: employment workshops in Paris and culture in
                    Alicante. I would be happy with attending either. I have been to Spain a lot in the past few years,
                    but
                    I cannot turn down the opportunity to practice my Spanish. Alternatively, I have been looking at
                    going
                    to Paris for a while, and this would give me ample opportunity to see all the sights. All trips are
                    five
                    days long, but the bursary applied to each varies. The opportunities I am eying up will cost me
                    around
                    £200, which is very good since accommodation and flights are included.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the academic year started today, the remaining freshers' activities are taking place almost
                    every
                    evening this week. I am not a drinker nor a clubber, so I don’t have much planned this week. The
                    pool
                    tournament I have been practicing for is taking place tomorrow night, marking the end of my
                    freshers.
                    Most of the societies have their first meetings or activities this week, so my evenings are almost
                    all
                    booked up anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    This evening, for instance, I was running with the group. We were doing laps around a track. Lauren
                    is
                    the pace setter, as she can run a mile in around 6.30 minutes. In total, we covered an accumulated
                    5k,
                    which is a nice round number. Upon finally running in my new trainers, I have come to the conclusion
                    that they are actually half a size too big for me. If I am duplicitous enough, I will clean them up
                    and
                    try to return them. Though that might be too devious even for a man with my flexible moral compass.
                    <br><br>
                    After running, I had Pilates booked at the Watershed. I hadn’t eaten anything in five hours, my
                    muscles
                    ached, my groin was tight, and my thigh was on the verge of being pulled. I was satisfied with the
                    exercise I had done for the day and was ready to shower and crawl into bed, but Kyra, one of the
                    runners, persuaded me to attend since she didn’t want to go alone. Having completed a couple of yoga
                    sessions, I was expecting much of the same. In truth, there were a lot of similar moves; however,
                    Pilates focused more on core exercises. Instead of completing them until you hit your rep target,
                    the
                    purpose is to control each movement and take your time, many of which activated my abs more than any
                    workout session in the past. Despite my trepidation, it felt like it soothed my aches and pains;
                    though
                    now, I have the added addition of stinging abs along with painful legs when I wake tomorrow.

                <p>
                    Treachery! I have just found out that ‘Fear Her’ has been removed from BBC iPlayer because that
                    episode
                    contains scenes with the disgraced Hugh Edwards. Doctor Who is well-known for including real
                    newsreaders
                    or presenters to increase the verisimilitude and Britishness of the show. While this contributes to
                    its
                    charm, it also means the show is subject to the ever-shifting landscape of BBC politics, which the
                    corporation must carefully navigate. Since Edwards' declasse status, the Beeb has rightly cut ties
                    with
                    him, but that means that any programs he has appeared in need to be removed from the public domain.
                    Alas, even episodes where he only features for a meagre few seconds. You would think the higher-ups
                    at
                    the Beeb would tactfully dub the scenes or even recut the episodes given the popularity of the show,
                    but
                    no. Hitherto, season two of Doctor Who is missing a much-loved episode…
                    <br><br>
                    Moving onto a less contentious part of my day, after last night’s festivities, I am walking around
                    zombie-like today. Anything less than the required eight hours of sleep gives me headaches.
                    Nevertheless, I trekked to Abbey Park to partake in the final fresher event and to round off a very
                    successful week of acclimatising to life back in Leicester. ‘Park Life’, as it is advertised, was
                    supposed to be a carnival-type affair with games, activities, crafts, and sports—mediums to help the
                    new
                    intake mix and socialise. Arriving at midday, an hour into these events, I was greeted with a rather
                    lacklustre show of DSU ambassadors and a scarcely filled park. Only a small group of students
                    decided to
                    show up, meaning the overall success of the event was wavering. It’s one of those things which takes
                    mass participation for the event to be successful. Despite the event being ‘sold out’ on the DSU
                    website, the actual turnout was met with general apathy, so I made a premature exit and had my first
                    relaxing day to myself, where I could watch the football and catch up on my reading.
                    <br><br>
                    In other news, Natalia has booked the tickets to see Jimmy Carr after consulting Mehmet. I have been
                    watching this venue for a while, so it’s good to finally have it booked. Alas, now I just need to
                    try
                    and fit it into my busy schedule.

                <p>
                    This is the first day which I have no DMU activities or sports on. Thankfully, instead of rattling
                    around my room for the day, I do have a few errands to run. After doing the weekly shop at the big
                    Tesco, I also picked up a few extra things for Octavia’s party tonight. It’s the first time meeting
                    up
                    with Emily and Natalia since before leaving for Stockholm so I am euphorically looking forward to
                    it. Of
                    course, Saturday’s are reserved for football and with Nana’s VirginGo installed on my iPad, this
                    makes
                    it significantly easier rather than finding a dodgy stream that doesn’t buffer. Pleased with
                    Middlesbrough’s two nil win over Stoke, I watched another film which had been on my watch list since
                    its
                    release: Miller’s Girl.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a low-budget flick, written by a writer with credits in the MCU and DC world but this was her
                    first stand-alone film which she also directed. Ignoring the low ratings on IMDB, I thought it was
                    enjoyable. Nothing too spectacular, but as a writer, I appreciate the quality vocabulary used in the
                    film. Facilely, the story follows the life of a student (Jenna Ortega) who takes inspiration from
                    her
                    English Professor's book and uses it in her college thesis. The issue is that the Professor’s book
                    contains an erotic scene and the student focuses entirely on that scene - writing fictitiously what
                    could happen between the student and the professor. I actually enjoyed it though it may be because
                    it is
                    based around writing and the narrative using a varied lexicon instead of the mundane vernacular
                    which
                    appeals to the mass market. Martin Freeman and Jenna Ortega are personal favourites of mine too.

                    Moving onto the festivities this evening. I wasn’t told that it was Octavia’s birthday on Monday
                    till
                    very late into the evening. Honestly, when they were bringing out the cake, it should have been a
                    giveaway but still I was ignorant of the fact. Natalia has continued working for the lecturer as a
                    research assistant which she was with for the majority of her final year. She did think about doing
                    a
                    PhD but ultimately opted against it. Technically, she is taking a gap year to get more experience
                    doing
                    research as that is what she hopes to be doing in the future. As it is a paltry wage; she is still
                    working at Starbucks on the weekend but as a manager now. Emily and Octavia work in the same care
                    facility, helping children with learning difficulties through the medium of drama. Very noble indeed
                    but
                    it does suit their empathetic need to help people.
                    <br><br>
                    Natalia’s boyfriend was there: Mehmet, who coincidentally, I had already met at the futsal session
                    yesterday. Small world huh. He is doing engineering and is part of the Racing Society which I’ve
                    signed
                    up to. I guess I’ll be seeing a lot of him. Good thing, he’s such a laid back type of person. Emily
                    and
                    Taves’ brothers also turned up; Mikey and Tobey who are good fun to be around. Mikey is 23 and works
                    in
                    a zoo. Toby is slightly more reserved but he is only 18 and starting UOL next week. I was the oldest
                    in
                    the room; a fact which I didn’t think bothered me but as I’ve had pointed out to me this week, this
                    is
                    starting to be a common occurrence. We played a lot of board games and a few party type games like
                    charades. All good fun of course. Living in the building attached to Highcross is very convenient
                    because it is a short walk through the shopping mall to get to their flat, however at two o’clock in
                    the
                    morning, I needed to add another fifteen minutes onto the journey, walking the circumference of the
                    buildings.
                    <br><br>
                    Exhausted, I was in bed and asleep by three o’clock. My springy bed isn’t as big an issue as I
                    initially
                    thought. Accordingly, when you’re tired enough, you’ll sleep anywhere. After the busy week I’ve had,
                    it’s not surprising that I haven’t had time to complain!

                <p>
                    After a busy four days meeting and greeting new people, today can be classed as a quasi day off.
                    There
                    is a ‘fun day’ at the DSU but based on the description of the event online, it sounds uninteresting
                    and
                    just a ploy in order to put another event on the schedule in order to make the purchase of the
                    freshers
                    wristbands seem good value. For the sole purpose of getting me out of the flat, I played football
                    instead. As it was mid-afternoon, it was a much quieter session but the skill level was distinctly
                    higher. This could be considered a training session for the DMU Futsal team because there were so
                    many
                    already distinguished players in the game. Nevertheless, I held my own. Scored a couple, assisted a
                    few
                    more. Try-outs will be interesting.
                    <br><br>
                    Came home to find my room had been broken into. Just kidding. The plumber had let himself in to fix
                    the
                    leaky toilet. The push button had too much pressure on it so he replaced the full body. He shares
                    similar views to me about Leicester. As he’s an Aussie, he only travels into Leicester for work but
                    couldn’t live here. If it wasn’t for his wife, he would be moving back to Australia. He’s the first
                    person I’ve met too who speaks complimentary about the British weather. After he was done, I had the
                    rest of the day to myself. ‘Miss Sloane’ has been on my watchlist forever so I finally had the time
                    to
                    sit down and enjoy it. No football is on tonight so I just relaxed feeling ebullient about my
                    successful
                    freshers week.

                <h2>Thursday, 26th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the same societies were occupying the DSU building, I was going to miss the final day of
                    freshers
                    since I have already signed up for half a dozen societies and clubs. However, the gentle persuasion
                    of
                    Hannah changed my mind. I met up with her and her friend Zed and checked out the DSU. Due to the
                    declining interest, a number of societies decided the third day wasn’t worth it so the tables were
                    only
                    occupying two floors, not three. Since almost everyone I’ve met this week is doing English
                    Literature or
                    some other form of Humanities, I have plenty in common with them. Zed is a facsimile of me from
                    first
                    year. Very taciturn and when she does speak, it’s laconic and meticulous. If she could have it her
                    way,
                    she would be getting dragged around freshers by Hannah. Anyway, afterwards we had a brief lunch from
                    one
                    of the stalls. It was very insipid food which is to be expected from makeshift food stalls. I bade
                    farewell as I wanted to play football this afternoon and needed to get back to change.
                    <br><br>
                    All the sessions at the Watershed are still part of the ‘taster experience’ therefore are free and
                    no
                    need to book. This is perhaps a hindrance rather than a benefit when thirty people show up to play
                    in a
                    meagre sized hall. The lads present were the same few who persuaded me to join the trials so they
                    were
                    easy to talk to. Because of the vast interest, more than half the allotted time my team sat on the
                    bench. Nevermind. Some of the current futsal team were there and they were scouting new talent.
                    <br><br>
                    After a quick shower and a brisk walk back to the Watershed, I partook in my second yoga session of
                    the
                    week. In the normal timetable, Yoga will clash with the DMU Hackers meetings on Thursday nights so
                    I’m
                    the epitome of ‘here for a good time, not a long time’ type thing. There was much more interest in
                    this
                    session which is understandable now everyone is finding their feet around campus. Francesca messaged
                    me
                    as the class was finishing saying she was running late. Poor time-management is clearly one of her
                    faults as she missed the entirety of the session. This could be perceived as divine intervention
                    because
                    I was caught in a thunderstorm on the way home. After camping out in the Watershed for ten minutes,
                    it
                    showed no signs of passing. Bravely wrapping up, I ran back to St Martins House but I was rightly
                    soaked
                    through. I do hope I don’t get a cold.

                <h2>Wednesday, 25th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Before attending day two of the freshers fair, I picked up more essentials from town. Instead of
                    doing
                    one big shop, I’ve been doing it in stages. I also had another purpose for visiting town today:
                    running
                    trainers. I had been scouting the shops up north, but they were too dear, as Nana would say. Here, I
                    have dedicated running shops and other independent retailers, which brought me an extended
                    selection.
                    The problem was, the prices skyrocketed in these retailers. Alas, I went to Sports Direct, even
                    though I
                    don’t like to support Mike Ashley. I managed to snag a pair of Asics for £64, which I think is
                    reasonable. As long as I don’t go mad shopping in the next few weeks, I’ll be able to amortise the
                    cost
                    from the largesse of the parents.
                    <br><br>
                    The freshers fair was not as popular today compared to yesterday. The DSU was just as busy with
                    societies, but the interest from the students had subsided. As promised, Dilan was there at the DMU
                    Hackers table. We had a brief but interesting catch-up. He’s still at IBM until the end of the week,
                    so
                    it’s almost guaranteed that he’ll have a job after graduating. The Hackers meetings happen weekly,
                    normally in Gateway House. Currently, that isn’t a problem, but during the second semester, I might
                    have
                    a seminar overlapping. Problem for later.
                    <br><br>
                    The most fortunate meeting of the day was seeing the stall for DMU Runners. This is a society that
                    simply goes running together. Since I’ve just bought new Asics this morning, I thought it was
                    prudent to
                    have a chat with them. Coincidentally, they are meeting at the pub this evening to get to know the
                    new
                    intakes. More on this to come. Being circumspect, I said I’d think about it. That was because I had
                    a
                    previous engagement for this evening: yoga.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s right. I’m turning into a spiritual middle-aged man. I’ll be reading tea leaves and telling
                    fortunes with a crystal ball if I’m not careful. Held at the Watershed, the session had only four
                    others
                    present. Strangely, all women; who’d have thought. The movements were slow and controlled. “It’s all
                    about breathing out the bad energy and inhaling the good energy.” The session was an hour long, and
                    we
                    were doing all the classic poses: downward dog, the chair, deep lunge, the rag doll. Oh yeah, I’ve
                    learnt a lot. We even meditated at the end; however, I admit I did find it difficult not to laugh
                    during
                    the silence at this new-age bollocks. “Focus on your breathing. Breathe in hopes and dreams. Breathe
                    out
                    negativity and impure thoughts.” What? Is this a front for a religious society now too?
                    <br><br>
                    I met Hannah and Francesca at this class. They’re starting their first year, both studying English
                    Literature. Obviously, we had a lot of similar interests and have read almost identical books.
                    Plenty of
                    Dickens and Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.G. Wells, even Shakespeare. Who knows, there may even be
                    hope
                    yet of reciting Shakespeare monologues to each other.
                    <br><br>
                    After a quick shower and a bite to eat, I headed back into town to meet the runners at Soar Point.
                    This
                    is the go-to place for society socials because of the generous deals offered to students and also
                    the
                    large TV screens showing football. The Karting society has an arrangement with the staff to watch
                    the F1
                    there on Sundays too, as long as it doesn’t clash with the football. No doubt, I’ll be a regular if
                    all
                    goes well.
                    <br><br>
                    The Running Society is good fun. There is a good mix of people, boys and girls. Very affable. We
                    played
                    cards and Uno, spoke about our subjects, and shared our hobbies other than running. I was at the
                    head of
                    the table with the committee members: Katie and Lauren, who were the undersecretaries. Tobias, who
                    had
                    graduated last year, is a very funny man and also a paramedic, so he’s a handy friend to have. I was
                    in
                    the Soar till around eleven before we headed out to Firebug, another pub whose USP was offering a
                    retro
                    gaming experience whilst people drink. Mario Karts, Black Ops zombies, MW3. I felt a wave of
                    nostalgia
                    just seeing the consoles. It was just myself and the committee members who ventured to Firebug, as
                    the
                    rest took the long voyage to Black Cats, which was part of the Freshers experience. As a
                    non-drinker, I
                    haven’t invested the £40 in a wristband to get me access to these clubs, but I was content to stay
                    with
                    the runners. I heard the Running Society is well-run. Well run—see what I did there? They have a
                    group
                    running almost every night of the week, so we can pick and choose our days and distances. They also
                    do
                    social runs where they dress up, which will be … eventful.

                <h2>Tuesday, 24th September</h2>
                <p>
                    Mark the date. My first attempt at being sociable. The DSU building was packed from the ground floor
                    to
                    the top with societies and sports teams, all trying to persuade you to join. No wonder I opted to
                    avoid
                    this in past years. This would have been an introvert's worst nightmare, having everyone asking
                    questions and engaging in conversation. Now, however, I welcomed the challenge. After queuing for
                    the
                    best part of an hour to even get in, it was actually enjoyable because I had previously looked
                    online at
                    potential simpatico societies. The stalls I was actively looking for included: DMU Hackers (a
                    computer
                    science society), Karters (a go-karting club that holds socials where they watch F1 together), and
                    Demon
                    Media (the De Montfort magazine and radio proprietors). I thought this triumvirate would be a good
                    place
                    to start.
                    <br><br>
                    Having scoured from top to bottom, I found the latter two but no sign of DMU Hackers.
                    Serendipitously, I
                    ran into Dilan on my way home, who happens to be on the committee. The reason for their absence was
                    due
                    to a lack of space in the building, but they would be there tomorrow.

                    The Karters were a passionate bunch, and they all shared simpatico views on F1 as I did. This looks
                    promising. I am less enthusiastic about Demon Media because the quality of the magazine looks
                    mediocre.
                    In conjunction with the poor design and large blank spaces permeating each page, the writing was
                    subpar.
                    I probably sound like Liam when I say that I could do a much more comprehensive job if I were to
                    take
                    over. Similarly to the futsal, I’m not looking for a heavy workload, just a medium in which I can
                    publish a few articles now and again. The first meetings are happening next week, so I will
                    definitely
                    give them a go at least. On my way out, the Futsal society cornered me, and they didn’t let me
                    bypass
                    them without signing up for the trials happening in the next few weeks. It’s nice to be wanted.

                    Back at St Martins House, a FIFA tournament was meant to be held, but the staff couldn’t work the
                    TV, so
                    that has been postponed till next week. Nevertheless, I held residence in the common room with a few
                    others, enjoying the conviviality. There were Nigerians, Londoners, Brummies, and me—purposely
                    confusing
                    them all with my northern vernacular. “I canny see the point in gandering about for no reason like”
                    was
                    a personal favourite malapropism of mine. The look of bewilderment on their faces was amusing in
                    itself.
                    Anyway, I have gained a few more followers on Insta, so we can keep in touch. Overall, they seem
                    like
                    good people.

                    The first week of moving into new accommodation is always the most expensive. Stocking up on the
                    essentials plus the weekly shop too, normally brings me to around £50 for the week. I was exhausted
                    for
                    some reason yesterday so I’ve been putting off the shopping and living on bread and the frozen foods
                    which the local Tesco Express stocks. I was carrying out the menial tasks today such as updating my
                    student card and re-registering for the forthcoming year so I was active anyway. The Diamond Jubilee
                    Leisure centre is on the way to the big Tesco’s so I enquired about the free classes available to
                    me.
                    Unbeknownst to me, it was completely the wrong place, leaving the receptionist perplexed about my
                    questions. Turns out, it’s actually the Watershed where the DMU Active session takes place - a DMU
                    owned
                    complex which has dedicated staff which also houses many of the sports societies too.
                    <br><br>
                    Following my productive conversation with the staff, I received a sheet with all the taster sessions
                    on
                    which would be happening throughout freshers. As futsal is the most popular, they are holding four
                    sessions this week so everyone has a chance. No need to sign up or register. Just turn up and play.
                    Simple. The futsal session was eventful. I wanted something relaxed, (if there is such a thing in
                    football), to keep me active throughout the year. Evidently there must have been a few members of
                    the
                    DMU futsal squad there scouting because I’ve been ushered to go to the try-outs. I didn’t
                    particularly
                    think my performance was as good as it normally is but the enthusiasm which the players had when
                    speaking about my skill was too ingratiating for me to say no. I guess I’ll be playing competitive
                    futsal this year…

                    My third flatmate moved in today too - Esther. She’s studying microbiology at UOL so I’m not sure
                    how
                    much I’ll see of her. She seems congenial like Summer but I still don’t know how close we are all
                    going
                    to be.

                <h2>Saturday, 21st September</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, the first day of my journey through my final year at university. After bidding adieu to the
                    parents from my new apartment building, I was able to explore. Being located almost centrally to
                    everywhere I go is ideal but the longer journey to the Tesco Superstore may become irksome after a
                    while. But for now, I am satisfied with my room; the bed is springy but it’s one of those things
                    I’ll
                    have to live with. Also from having brief chats with the staff at the reception, this location is
                    normally quiet due to the reduced number of rooms compared to their sister buildings. My only
                    roommate
                    at the moment seems cordial which is all I can ask for at this point. I just hope this ‘university
                    experience’ which I so craved does not come to bite me on the arse because down the road when I have
                    a
                    full apartment.
