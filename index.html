            <h2>Tuesday, 3rd December</h2>
            <p>
                The BBC open call deadline closed at midday today, and I’m relieved to have submitted my pilot
                manuscript over the weekend. Scriptwriting is a completely new skill for me, so I was learning on the
                fly to ensure it met industry standards. Honestly, I find it less stressful than novel writing—there’s
                no need to obsess over intricate descriptions of surroundings. Just dialogue, a few stage directions,
                and done. There’s no word on the website about when feedback will be provided, probably because it
                depends on when they finish reviewing submissions. I’m not desperate for this to lead to a job, but I’m
                definitely eager to get some constructive feedback on my work.
                <br><br>
                This afternoon should have been dedicated to three hours of Software Methods and Standards, a session
                that usually feels like a marathon. But today was different. When I arrived, the Hawthorne building—home
                to the Health and Science labs—was locked, and all the students were gathered on the grass outside.
                Speculation was rife: a chemical leak? Poison gas? An Ebola outbreak? Nobody had any answers, but the
                gossip alone almost made the trip worthwhile.
                <br><br>
                Under normal circumstances, I’d celebrate an unexpected free afternoon. I’d head home, put on a film,
                maybe get some writing done, or tinker with my website. But missing this session actually frustrated me.
                I’m already grappling with the purpose of this module, and skipping lectures and seminars isn’t helping
                to clarify things. Still, there wasn’t much to do but head home.
                <br><br>
                I’ve nearly finished my writing portfolio, though I still need to rework my website's style. The
                feedback I’ve received so far keeps pointing out its uncanny resemblance to the BBC site, so that’s
                something to tackle over the holidays. With the Christmas break starting in a week and a half, it’ll
                keep me busy and productive. I’ve also got to squeeze in Christmas shopping for my Leicester friends
                before next Friday, so the next few days are shaping up to be full-on.

        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Monday, 2nd December</h2>
            <p>I got my first glimpse of the magazine today, and overall, it looks professional. It’s sleek and
                well-designed on many pages. However, it’s clear the designers weren’t informed about the page margins,
                which will result in some content being cut off during printing. As a result, some pages will appear
                disjointed due to text being lost in the process. While the online version will be fine, that doesn’t
                excuse the chief designers for not properly briefing their team.
                <br><br>
                The magazine is thirty-two pages long, featuring around eighteen articles—a solid achievement,
                especially since previous editions only reached a total of eighteen pages. I met with Jess, the
                editor-in-chief, to discuss the website (which is outdated and visibly in need of a refresh). During our
                meeting, she also brought up several issues with the magazine that go beyond design. It turns out the
                section editors are either careless proofreaders or dyslexic—perhaps both. Regardless, they shouldn’t
                have volunteered for the job if they weren’t confident in their skills. There were spelling mistakes,
                grammatical errors, and even a random sentence in the middle of one page where the editor had forgotten
                to copy the entire text into the final draft. Fortunately, my sections were written and edited by me, so
                they were error-free. As a result, Jess has asked me to take on the role of Health and Lifestyle editor,
                thanks to my meticulous eye for detail—and, of course, my lack of dyslexia.
                <br><br>
                Jess and her friends are studying journalism, so this is their area of expertise. For me, this is just
                another opportunity to branch out beyond my Computer Science degree. Apparently, all journalism students
                are encouraged to start blog websites in their first year, so Jess and I took the chance to exchange and
                critique each other's work. Jess is an impressive writer for someone who dislikes reading. It still
                confounds me that many aspiring journalists are so averse to reading books, biographies, or even the
                news, despite it being a core part of their profession. Nevertheless, Jess clearly falls into that small
                percentage of people who possess a natural talent for writing.

            <h2>Sunday, 1st December</h2>
            <p><em>It's Christmas! </em>Officially and unequivocally. Dust off that Mariah Carey EP, get Love Actually
                on, make sure to have a bucket of water balloons next to the door in case the carol singers come
                calling. Oh, what a wonderful time of the year. Leicester is buzzing with the Christmas spirit. The
                Christmas lights got switched on in town last week (in November, I know!) and the Tree’s already been
                decorated and lit up under the town clock. As for me, it’s hard to get into the Christmas spirit when
                I’m expecting a fair amount of work to be dropped on me in the coming days. However, for today, it’s a
                glorious day of football and F1. No pending deadlines as of yet and no responsibilities for the Radio
                station or the magazine. Life is good.

            <h2>Saturday, 30th November</h2>
            <p>
                I got complimented on my style today. From a fashion student too so that lends some credence to their
                opinions do you think?
                <br><br>
                I was in the pub for the majority of the day. First watching the Boro dispatch Hull and then the three
                o’clock kickoffs followed by the Formula One qualifying. I was bouncing between three groups of friends
                all afternoon. Mehmet and his Turkish friends all have a strong predilection for Arsenal for some reason
                so they were in jovial spirits when Arsenal scored their fourth. A little bit of trepidation crept into
                their voices when West Ham decided to stage a daring comeback but the overall result remained firmly in
                Arsenal’s favour.
                <br><br>
                The F1 qualifying was disappointing with Verstappen taking pole. Out of the twenty DMU Racers that
                turned up to the pub, not one supported Red Bull. More than half are Mercedes or McLaren fans. We’ve got
                some French students supporting Alpine, a few Germans supporting Sauber and one Italian cheering for
                Ferrari. But not one Red Bull supporter in the house. The season is all but over with only the
                constructors title still left to compete for but the general apathy is starting to take hold. We headed
                over to the pool tables, where I managed to win a few free drinks off the lads - naturally, my snooker
                endowments came in handy. It’s a shame I don’t drink so instead I just took their cash. Always a
                pleasure, lads.

            <h2>Friday, 29th November</h2>
            <p>
                After a long day yesterday, I was in for an even longer day today. The new module - Software Development
                Methods & Standards - is as byzantine as it sounds. Each teacher has a different pedology style which
                makes the overall structure of the course unnecessarily complex. It would be a prodigious help if we
                were given clear instructions on the assessment from an early stage instead of keeping us in the dark
                until they find it prudent to spring it on us. The schedule has us attending one lecture a week and
                three two-hour seminars. This is problematic in itself because seminars are not recorded, nor are the
                powerpoints uploaded for further revision (because most of the time it’s just a discussion and not
                anything worth creating a presentation for).
                <br><br>
                A module that solely relies on students attending petrifies me because how are we supposed to revise for
                the inevitable phase test at the end. Are we going to be quizzed on questions that we’ve spoken about in
                the seminars or is the module leader going to ask us to do a presentation of our own? I’m at the end of
                the first week out of seven and this module is proving to be more enigmatic than a <em>Sherlock
                Holmes</em> tale.
                <br><br>
                I did my radio slot producing another banger of a show; further developing my nascent knowledge of the
                broadcasting world. It may be superficial based on my projected career path but it brings me great
                pleasure sitting in that booth controlling the station with only myself responsible each week. Also, I
                found out why Ghost has given herself/himself that particular nickname. She/he was oddly overt with
                sharing it. When she/he committed suicide in 2019, she/he thought she/he saw herself/himself as an
                apparition. It may have been an outer body experience or just a deluge of chemicals flooding the brain
                but she/he was adamant in her/his belief. Since then she/he is now living vicariously through this
                ethereal spirit. I wonder if she/he saw herself/himself as the opposite gender which is why referring to
                her/him now takes twice as long. Nevertheless, this is the fourth person to openly express their
                suicidal tendencies to the group.
                <br><br>
                The Health and Wellbeing role in each society is normally a nominal position; there to satisfy the
                universities inclusion and acceptance policies but in Demon Media, it should be a full-time position.
                Somewhat ironically, he’s taken the past two weeks off because he’s got anxiety and depression himself…

            <h2>Thursday, 28th November</h2>
            <p>
                I’m off to London. Again. And similar to last time I am up and down in a day. Just a brief sojourn to
                break up the monotony of coding and writing. So what was the purpose this time? Well I’m seeing a play.
                <em>The play’s the thing.</em> But surprisingly it’s not Shakespeare on this occasion. <em>The
                Duchess</em> starring Jodie Whittaker has been on my wishlist for some time and with the current run
                coming to an end next month, I needed to schedule an impromptu trip to see it.
                <br><br>
                I had no preconceived notions since I hadn’t read it but my English Literature friends hold it in high
                regard. I thought I had a good grasp of things after the first half. A comedic love story similar to
                that of Romeo and Juliet. The Duchess is recalcitrant of her brothers so she chooses to marry one of her
                stewards shortly after becoming a widow. Once the brothers find out, the Steward has to flee with their
                two young children. After the intermission, I think John Webster had too much hopped beer. Torture,
                murder, perfidy. A rapid change of tone compared to the light-hearted merriment of the first half. Heart
                wrenching throughout but unnecessarily graphic at certain points. Seeing the projection of the Duchess’
                husband and son being shot repeatedly on a loop on the white backdrop of the stage was more like torture
                for the audience instead of for the Duchess.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I was impressed with the play. It was good but I couldn’t help but feel that it could have been
                great had it not been for the modern revisions to adapt it from the original. The random musical
                interludes by a spectre dressed in white, (I assume she was supposed to depict an angel watching over
                the Duchess after she was murdered), slowed the pace down monumentally. The comedy aspects could be
                removed too as it’s supposed to be a grievous revenge tragedy. The dialogue with the English Literature
                students behind me agreed with this notion seeing they weren’t overly impressed with the modern
                revisions. Mainly the superfluous swearing. It had a contrary effect rather than the intense earnestness
                that was intended.
                <br><br>
                After <em>The Duchess</em>, I headed over to the Apollo Theatre for <em>Fawlty Towers - The Play</em>.
                Again, I didn’t do any research into the play but as I’d seen the TV show, I figured it would be a
                continuation of the story with Basil, Cybil and Polly. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed. It was
                just a round-up of the greatest hits. It was a two hour performance and in the first five minutes we’ve
                been told to expect the hotel inspectors, Cybils ingrown toenail, the Germans and that pesky moose.
                Expectedly, Mrs Richardson made an appearance along with a poor facsimile of Bernnie Cribbins’ Mr
                Hutchinson character.
                <br><br>
                I’m sure it’s a fan favourite and the audience were laughing at the jokes but I was contemplating
                leaving at the interval. I knew what was coming up and many of the scenes were rushed in order to cram
                in as many storylines as possible. It was a great rendition of the Basil Fawlty character, culminating
                with the hilarious sketch with the Germans, but ultimately, I feel like this was an evening wasted. I
                would have been much better suited watching <em>The Mousetrap</em>. Even if it is just my own
                expectations that have let me down on this occasion.

            <h2>Wednesday, 27th November</h2>
            <p>
                It’s only taken me eleven months since becoming receptive to new films, but I’ve finally sat down to
                watch <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. About an hour in, I thought I might have misinterpreted
                its primary themes because it could almost be categorized as a comedy. McMurphy organizing a basketball
                game with the Chief, standing under the net to block free throws, and casually walking up the court to
                score points felt almost whimsical. Then there’s the scene of chartering the fishing boat with eleven -
                <em>err, doctors</em> - after stealing the school bus.
                <br><br>
                It wasn’t until the final act that the darker realities of life in a mental hospital took center stage.
                Electric shock therapy is always depicted as a draconian measure, often portrayed as the stuff of
                nightmares. McMurphy’s character doesn’t seem to change after the first round, but the second leaves him
                incapacitated. I also suspected Billy would commit suicide, though I anticipated it happening at a
                different point in the film.
                <br><br>
                If I were to do an analytical study on the reasons behind Billy’s actions, I’d arraign Nurse Ratched as
                the cause. Her deep infatuation with power over her patients overwhelmed her duty to help them. Despite
                McMurphy’s tragic end, there’s a poetic symmetry in the Chief using McMurphy’s escape plan for his own
                bid for freedom. Solid 9.5/10. Now, I just need to watch <em>The Shining</em> to complete the Jack
                Nicholson trifecta from the New Hollywood era. Who would have thought I’d end up watching a French film
                before <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>?

                Who hovers at 3am?! Is this some sort of nervous tick or a coping mechanism? Whatever it is, can it be
                postponed till first light?
                <br><br>
                I got my mark back from the case analysis that I submitted almost a month ago. 90%. Good I’m a good
                writer. My skill with the quill is undeniable, and my lectures just can’t get enough of my ostentatious
                lexicon. I’ve evidently chosen the wrong course because I still can’t code for toffee.
                <br><br>
                It was the start of my next module as well today. It is similar to the Agile Development module I took
                in second year because when the course has been ‘reimagined’, (as the faculty put it), anyone who went
                on a placement or on an Erasmus exchange is now being penalised and stymied. There are topics which I
                won’t cover and multiple subjects which I will be repeating. Not ideal in terms of learning but it does
                aid me in my journey for that first.
                <br><br>
                I swifty headed to the radio studios to sort out the show for Friday night. Jamie’s very laissez-faire,
                meaning that he allows me to sort the running order and the timings out. After two years of producing
                his own <em>New Music Medley</em> show on Friday nights, I think he’s appreciative of my assistance in
                the studio.

            <h2>Monday, 25th November</h2>
            <p>
                I watched a foreign film today. <em>Belle de Jour</em>. As you might have guessed, it’s French. But
                honestly, I think I would have found it just as confusing if it was in English. It’s about a woman who’s
                unfulfilled in her marriage and has a penchant for sadomasochism. To satisfy her fantasies, she spends
                her afternoons in a brothel which she enjoys but her secret is exposed when one of her clients is
                friends with her husband. What confused me about the film was trying to discern what was real and what
                was a dream. The first scene shows Belle getting carried off into the woods where she is whipped after
                her husband finds out about her infidelity. This would make sense to the story but is inconsistent with
                the ending (which was also premature! I was expecting another ten minutes to complete the denouement.)
                The ending has Belle’s husband convalescing from being shot by an infatuated client but then in the same
                scene, the paralysed husband gets up and hugs Belle. AND THEN IT ENDS.
                <br><br>
                EXPLAIN IT.
                <br><br>
                PLEASE.
                <br><br>
                It is still a good film but what could have made it better was the clear distinction of what was real
                and what was fictitious. There weren’t any clever camera angles or incorporeal jingles which told us
                when Belle was in a reverie so it’s up to the audience to figure it out. Reading up on the film, this is
                the director’s modus operandi which is why his is so revered in the surrealist film genre. My brain
                hurts. Perhaps, I better stick to <em>Film Noir</em>.
                <br><br>
                After banging my head against a wall several times, trying to decipher the film, I headed to the radio
                station to do a four hour stint, producing. It wasn’t supposed to be double-bubble but after I did the
                first two hour slot with Jamie, I was beseeched by the Station Manager to produce the next show because
                the host was struggling with the dual-roles of presenter and producer. I have to say I agree with
                Angel’s opinion because Lantern, yes that’s really her name, (his name?) kept pressing the wrong buttons
                and erroneously assuming her mic was off when it wasn’t. The nadir of her show was when she/he/they
                swore twice and accidentally turned the sound mixer off resulting in dead-air for thirty seconds. And
                that was all in the first five minutes. <em>Amateur</em>.
                <br><br>
                Just to top this off, she/he/they also has crippling anxiety therefore proceeded to have a panic attack
                whilst I’m trying to sort the mixing desk out. I think the Station manager foresaw this which is why she
                disappeared as soon as I stepped back into the studio. For those who were listening, they were probably
                wondering why a series of tracks from <em>The Jam, Madness</em> and <em>The Killers</em> filled the
                airways during a Musical Medley show. Really, I could do a show without a presenter and just play
                consecutive songs for an hour. It’ll give me valuable time to play with the technology and gain a little
                more experience. Unfortunately the software we use is only available in the studios so we can’t prepare
                shows on our laptops. I’ve spoken to Ian who is the Radio station technician and he agrees with my
                inference that is more annoying than it is practical but he can’t do anything to address this. I
                suggested virtualisation or using VMs, (surprisingly, he knew what these terms meant without me
                explaining them) but he stopped me in my tracks. He explained the limitations that have plagued the
                student Radio station for years and touched on the infinitesimal resources he was operating with. I
                think his explanation was more meretricious than forthright; giving a bit of flim-flam to stop me from
                asking more questions. Either way, it just gives me an excuse to spend more time in the studio rather
                than on my own.
                <br><br>
                Also, Mother made me send her back my Christmas money, probably because of all the talk about MacBooks
                on Saturday. I imagine she thinks I’m profligate and going to waste my money on something like that…

            <p>
                The Las Vegas Grand Prix kicked off at 6 a.m. UK time, which meant setting my alarm for the ungodly hour
                of 5:30am. Why? To catch Martin Brundle’s iconic grid walk, of course. Predictably, anyone with even a
                whiff of fame descended on the event, desperate to attach their names to this glittering spectacle.
                <br><br>
                Let me be clear: I’m still not a fan of this race being on the F1 calendar. The U.S. already boasts
                races in Austin, Texas, and Miami, Florida. Meanwhile, countries like those in Africa are campaigning
                for their shot at hosting a Grand Prix, only to be sidelined in favour of Vegas’s flashy appeal. In any
                other GP weekend, the race itself is the main event. But here in Las Vegas? It feels more like an
                accessory to the pomp and pageantry.
                <br><br>
                <em>Rant over.</em>
                <br><br>
                On to the race: George Russell dominated from start to finish, with Lewis Hamilton close behind, making
                it a stellar weekend for Mercedes and British fans. But, as expected, Max Verstappen clinched the
                Drivers' Championship, which, let’s be honest, was always a foregone conclusion. Still, Verstappen’s
                triumph somewhat dims the glow of what was otherwise a fantastic result for the Britons.
                <br><br>
                The race wrapped up by 7:45am. I was out running by 8am. Finished eating my eggs for breakfast by 9.
                Then found myself bored with nothing left to do until Super Sunday rolled around.

            <p>
                I find myself in desperate need of a new laptop - though "new" doesn't quite capture the full scope of
                what I'm after. No, I need an upgrade. The truth is, I go through laptops with the same recklessness as
                Henry Fonda did marriages. Three laptops in three years at university - each succumbing to some form of
                untimely demise, and all entirely beyond my control. One, tragically, met its end when it was
                inadvertently sat upon by a Swedish commuter on the metro. But I digress.
                <br><br>
                As I approach the more demanding stages of my degree, my laptop has become the critical tool for running
                heavy-duty software: web servers, virtual machines, Android emulators. These resource-intensive
                applications tax my system’s capabilities to their limit, causing frequent crashes, draining battery
                life, and putting my laptop through a ceaseless grind.
                <br><br>
                I’ve always avoided MacBooks, primarily due to their inflated price tags. After all, the same specs on a
                Lenovo can be found for a good £400 less than the equivalent MacBook. That said, I can no longer ignore
                the reality: Macs are built to run exactly the type of resource-hungry programs I use on a daily basis,
                making them far more efficient than my current setup. Beyond that, having a Mac would eliminate the
                frustration of juggling between operating systems. I currently run both Windows and Linux to accommodate
                different software needs, which forces me into a constant, time-consuming switch. Take, for example, the
                Adobe Suite that I use for audio editing and Photoshop that are only supported by Windows. Conversely, I
                prefer Linux because coding is infinitely more manageable, thanks to its seamless access to the
                terminal.
                <br><br>
                MacBooks, in contrast, strike the balance of compatibility across all these applications, as they’re
                widely used and universally supported. But here’s the catch: despite all their merits, there is simply
                no way I’m justifying a £1500 laptop purchase when I’m down to only six months left at university. I
                should have invested in one three years ago instead of buying the gaming laptop which I subsequently
                sold…

                Last week, I suspected my flatmates of being thieves. Today, I uncovered the truth. It wasn't the
                teenagers, Esther or Summer - no, the culprit is Marvin, the 30-year-old man. He's the one who’s been
                taking my cutlery. If you want to use them, fine - let’s share. Use it, wash it, and put it back,
                simple. But let’s not start taking each other’s things and claiming them as our own, stashing them in
                our own cupboards. I did ask him about it, and instead of denying it, his response was so baffling that
                I can only describe it as resembling the behaviour of someone with dementia - he seemed to have no
                recollection of ever using any cutlery whatsoever. <em>Sigh</em>. I suppose this is the game we’re
                playing now. I really don’t want to start storing kitchen utensils in my room but that might be the only
                thing left to do if this thievery persists, especially after I’ve confronted him.
                <br><br>
                A quick update: You remember the review I wrote for Dalia, reflecting on my year in Stockholm? Well, one
                of the three questions I answered has now been published. To recap, the task was to provide advice we
                wish we had received before, during, and after our Erasmus year. My section, which focused on advice for
                the pre-Erasmus phase, has been published - but not without considerable censorship, which I strongly
                suspect was carried out by Dalia herself.
                <br><br>
                There is not a single issue mentioned - no culture shock, no visa delays, no difficulties of any kind.
                The reviews paint an entirely unrealistic picture, suggesting that Erasmus students simply choose their
                destination, board a plane, are met with open arms, make an abundance of new friends, accumulate
                boundless experience, and leave with perfect exam scores, longing for another year abroad. This is not
                an embellishment; it is outright mendacity.
                <br><br>
                Had Dalia desired only uncritical, positive feedback, she should have made that explicit from the
                outset. Instead, she used the ‘tailor it to your own experience’ spiel knowing unequivocally that not
                everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows. It just feels somewhat deceptive, especially given
                that all the reviews follow the same script now. Overt advertisements for the Erasmus program instead of
                genuine, nuanced reflections from the participants.

                I slept in this morning; something I’ve not been able to do in the two months since I moved in due to
                the uncooperative spring placement which sticks me in the side when I roll over. However yesterday,
                after a flip and a twist, all is well again. It’s not the first time it’s been flipped as evidenced by
                the stain in one corner, nevertheless, it clearly is more comfortable after the ten hours of
                uninterrupted sleep I’ve had.
                <br><br>
                It is the fourth day of the holidays and I have not been as productive as I would have liked, though not
                for lack of trying. I’ve been sociable and I have been coding but I haven’t achieved the projects which
                I noted on my to-do list last weekend. Debugging, as always, is a Sisyphean task: hours of work, oceans
                of frustration, and at the end of it all, my boulder is right back at the bottom of the hill. <em>(Thank
                you Stephen Fry for the lessons in Greek Mythology).</em>
                <br><br>
                In dire need of a break, I caught up with Natalia at her flat this afternoon. Not Polish Natalia - well,
                yes, Polish Natalia, but not <em>that</em> Polish Natalia. Not the one teaching me photography - this is
                Natalia who I’ve known the longest who’s a researcher. Natalia who knows campus gossip like the back of
                her hand. You’d think graduating would loosen her grip on the pulse of university drama, but no.
                Ostensibly, she is a teacher because her job title is researcher but really she’s sat in a lab all day.
                Apparently, spending her days reading all the department emails which she’s cc’ed in on meaning she’s
                got the inside scoop on redundancies, departmental squabbles, and other staff grievances. It’s not
                exactly the scandal and intrigue in <em>His Girl Friday</em>, but it does offer a peek behind the
                academic velvet curtain.

            <p>
                This evening marked a milestone: I produced my first solo radio show. Ghost was opposite me in the
                booth, presenting with her usual flair. (Why she insists on using a pseudonym remains a mystery. I've
                long since stopped trying to decipher the eccentricities of the media society - it’s an endless rabbit
                hole.) My role? Sound checks, monitoring levels, ensuring everything ran smoothly. And it was… until the
                group chat erupted.
                <br><br>
                The messages started rolling in. All informing us that we were doing it wrong. In fact, that was the
                common threat of all their messages. Verbatim: ‘You are doing it wrong’. Lacks a certain specificity
                don’t you think. What? What is wrong? Tell me. The feed? Interference? A rogue cable? A meteor striking
                the studio? I wanted answers, but instead, I got a deluge of similarly unhelpful messages. It felt like
                trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing. Still, I kept my cool and reassured Ghost. After
                all, as the BBC speaker at last week’s talk so wisely put it: <em>“As producer, it’s your job to smile
                and wave, even if the sound mixer is ablaze.”</em>
                <br><br>
                So, we soldiered on. Ghost was in her element, delivering a stellar show, while I maintained my façade
                of calm professionalism, inwardly unravelling the mystery of what’s gone wrong. Eventually, Angel, our
                station manager (currently gallivanting on a DMUGlobal trip in Croatia), swooped into the chat like a
                deus ex machina, ejecting the troublemakers. It turns out the culprits were a group of disgruntled
                former members; students who’d been ousted from the society for violating some nebulous rules. From what
                I’ve gathered (a patchwork of whispered gossip and cryptic commentary from the board), their bitterness
                still festers.
                <br><br>
                With that drama resolved, the rest of the show ran like clockwork. Ghost dazzled, and I managed to keep
                everything humming along. And now? I’m apparently in demand as a producer for Friday’s medley show. It
                seems being a producer is prime real estate in the media society - everyone wants a show, but no one
                wants to tackle the tech. Hot commodity or not, tonight was a success. Drama, feedback loops, and all.

                I received my first email regarding the Paris trip happening in the spring next year. It looks like
                there will be nineteen people in total, eleven girls and six boys, excluding myself. I can’t quite
                figure out what it is that deters the lads from joining these kinds of trips. The same pattern emerged
                when I went to Bilbao in my first year, where only myself and two other guys went, compared to the
                twelve girls on that trip. Not that I mind. I ended up meeting two of my closest friends, Natalia and
                Emily, on our visit to Spain. It’s easier to mingle in a group like that, especially when everyone is
                intrepid enough to sign up for the experience in the first place. You can usually count on them not
                being the taciturn type.
                <br><br>
                This afternoon, I met Natalia to do a photography session. Not the same Natalia mentioned above, this is
                Polish Natalia. Wait, that doesn’t work, Natalia from Warsaw. Nope, that doesn’t either. Natalia who
                does film production, who I met a few weeks ago. Yep, that works. We’re going out with our cameras so
                she can show me how to level up my photos. The first drops of snow were coming down and the snowflakes
                were large enough to see on camera, giving us a winter wonderland backdrop. After our session, we ended
                up in a coffee shop with our laptops. Since she’s also got experience in sound editing and photoshop,
                she’s in the process of teaching me those skills too. Turning out to be a very prosperous friendship.

                Since the first module is over and I finally have time to breathe again, I can better appreciate the
                subtle nuances I miss from Stockholm. The idiosyncrasies I had there, which once seemed so
                inconsequential, are now uniquely tied to my experience in Sweden. Take, for instance, the ritual of
                reading my Kindle every day on the metro. I still read now - I've just finished Lord of the Flies
                (which, incidentally, has a fantastic ending) - but not with the same consistency or for the same length
                of time as I did last year. The 45-minute uninterrupted journey from Kista to the Frescati campus
                offered the perfect opportunity to lose myself in a good book. These days, with my packed schedule of
                extracurriculars, I seldom have the luxury of a spare hour.
                <br><br>
                The most obvious aspect of Stockholm I miss is its idyllic charm - the canals, Gamla Stan, the royal
                residence, and, of course, the meatballs. While I am more active and sociable in Leicester than I ever
                was in Stockholm, that does not imply I disliked my solitude there. Long walks through the city were a
                cherished routine - until the cold winter descended, at least.
                <br><br>
                Which brings me neatly to why I don’t entirely miss Stockholm. It was around this time last year that
                the plunging temperatures drove me indoors. I spent those months binge-watching Tom Baker’s seasons of
                <em>Doctor Who</em>, venturing out only for groceries or weekends away to other European capitals.
                <br><br>
                Yet, for all I’m enjoying myself in Leicester, there remains something magical about my time in
                Scandinavia - majestic, even. There was a quiet ostentation in being able to say, “I live in Stockholm.”
                It made people sit up and listen. Perhaps that’s what I miss most: the glamour, the sense of reverence,
                which Leicester, for all its merits, so conspicuously lacks.
                <br><br>
                It feels like I’ve been talking about Stockholm a lot recently. I’ve made a lot of new acquaintances
                through clubs and societies and one of my best anecdotes starts with ‘During my year in Stockholm…’.
                I’ve also been spending more time with Daria and a few of the other incoming exchange students which is
                why Stockholm is constantly on my mind. They all want to see as much of Leicester as they can whilst
                they are here and expect me to give them tours. Unfortunately, my unadventurous first and second years
                have left me in the same position as them - wanting to explore a city I’ve never fully discovered
                myself. It’s a bit embarrassing, considering I’ve already lived here for two years.

                My module is finished and yet I still find myself in the basement of the library at quarter past eight
                on a Saturday morning. Why would anyone be in the library at that ungodly hour the day after the exams?
                Well, foolishly I left my keyboard in the Radio studio last night so I needed to hasten back to get it
                before it was stolen. Seeing that I was on campus, I might as well start working whilst it’s quiet. I
                have no official deadlines however there are certain topics and skills that I want to learn or remind
                myself of whilst I have some free time. It would have been a great revision session had it not been for
                the open day tours disturbing me every fifteen minutes.

            <p>
                All that preparation. The countless hours immersed in esoteric concepts, navigating the labyrinth of Big
                Data and AI. All those efforts distilled into a multiple-choice quiz that was over in a mere five
                minutes. 18 out of 20. With 80% of the module now complete, I’ve already secured more than enough to
                clinch a first. And that’s without factoring in the case analysis, still pending evaluation.
                <br><br>
                A year ago, I was grappling with essay-style answers for each question in my exams, assessments
                stretching to four-hour marathons. Now, I’m breezing through quizzes tied to a single lecture from just
                two weeks prior. I can't complain - I've learned plenty. Yet, the stark contrast between the two systems
                is striking, almost unsettling. And this, despite the UK’s standing as a global paragon of education.
                With the module behind me, a week of respite awaits. It’s important I use this time effectively.
                <br><br>
                Like spending it in the radio studio. Friday nights are the Demon FM meetings where we are learning the
                inner-workings of the mixer desk and the software. Tonight was a small gathering since it is the final
                day of the module and most people are getting their coursework finished by the midnight deadline. It
                gave me more time on the decks and the Zetta network. It’s a lot to take in but rather intuitive
                therefore I’m confident that I’ll be able to pick it up. Producing sounds like a nice gig. I don’t need
                to be on the microphones and I can control everything from behind the sound desk. Sounds like a perfect
                job. However that means it’s down to me to be trigger-ready on the mute buttons if I think a swear is
                coming. Ofcom takes that sort of stuff seriously, <em>apparently</em>.

            <p>
                Another day of revision. I am dedicating most of my days to the exam I have tomorrow. I have been a
                regular in the library and have been recapping everything. Rather superfluously, I should add since I
                only need a paltry five correct answers out of twenty to achieve my 70% target overall.
                <br><br>
                Today, I also received another delightful email from DMUGlobal - their messages seem to be the highlight
                of my inbox. In case I haven’t mentioned, I’ll be heading to Paris in April. Exciting huh. Just days
                after my participation was confirmed, I was invited to apply for additional funding. Normally, I’d
                overlook such an offer, given that I come from a comfortably low-middle-class background. But to my
                surprise, I actually meet three out of the six eligibility criteria. Traditionally, funding has been
                more targeted at students from BAME backgrounds or low-income neighbourhoods. However, DMU seems to be
                broadening its criteria, recognizing that support should extend to a wider range of demographics. They
                now consider factors like parents' educational background, status as a mature student, or whether one
                comes from an economically challenged postcode. Thanks to these adjustments, I qualify for an extra £200
                in funding, meaning that my trip to Paris will cost me only £25 in total. Propitiously, I didn’t even
                need to resort to the usual tactics of persuasion or subtle manipulation that I sometimes rely on
                advertising my harrowing cleft palate condition.
                <br><br>
                Also, the cutlery thief has struck again. This is ridiculous.

                100% in the coursework - a personal record for me. In Stockholm when I needed to present, I always found
                it daunting and intimidating. Even if the code worked and had no issues, my grade rested on whether I
                could persuade the lecturer, who I’d barely spoken to, of its authenticity. This morning was different
                though. I had Dilan next to me and Osama is a much gentler figure than the weight-lifting, ex-wrestling,
                former-female heavyweight Swedish boxing champion, Beatrice Acklebloom who was my programming professor
                in Stockholm. (Quite a resume she’s got too!) I now only have the phase test on Friday and then that’s
                the module over. Because of how it’s weighted, I only need 15% in the exam to end the module with a
                first. Quite a result given my apathy for Mobile App Development.
                <br><br>
                This afternoon, I attended a careers day hosted by the BBC, this time focused on opportunities in radio
                for students. Although radio isn’t exactly my field, the event still resonated with the professional
                paths I’m exploring - and it's not every day the Beeb comes to town! I’m keeping my options open, but
                I’m still uncertain about what I want to pursue after graduation. Data analysis, web development, media
                production, writing... so many choices and so little time.

            <h2>Tuesday, 12th November</h2>
            <p>
                Tonight was Hackers Society’s game night - a chance for everyone to head to Firebug, unwind, enjoy some
                classic pub-grub, and dive into a lineup of games. No hacking, coding, or tech talk, just pure fun. We
                played chess, Uno, Cards Against Humanity, Mario Kart, and Wii Sports. Honestly, it felt like a
                ten-year-old's birthday party, and I loved every minute of it.
                <br><br>
                Most of the crowd already knew each other from last year’s society, so they had a good sense of who to
                avoid in chess. Given that everyone here is either a Computer Science or Cyber Security major - and,
                let’s just say, equipped with a distinctly analytical mindset - I assumed they’d all be like Magnus
                Carlsen on the chessboard. Feeling somewhat emboldened from my victory against a first year, I
                challenged Jack, the reigning Hackers champion. His reputation clearly preceded him, as no one else
                seemed willing to take him on.
                <br><br>
                We sat down, and the game was afoot. Twenty-five minutes later, I had him checkmated. Turns out, what I
                have can’t be taught. I am inimitable… As I declared checkmate, a collective “ooo” resonated across the
                room. There’s a new sheriff in town, folks.
                <br><br>
                The night continued, and I was in high spirits, still riding the thrill of my chess victory. Soon, <em>Trivial
                Pursuit</em> made an appearance. Although my knowledge of general world trivia is iffy at best, it
                didn’t seem to matter with the usual barrage of obscure questions. Then, a twist of fate: <em>Doctor Who
                Trivial Pursuit</em>. Apparently, Hackers Society could just as easily be a Whovian club, as everyone
                around the table turned out to be die-hard fans. Now I was genuinely excited.
                <br><br>
                Sitting among Doctor Who enthusiasts, exchanging theories, dissecting episodes, actors, storylines, plot
                twists, and character arcs, was a dream come true. Honestly, this group might even be more dedicated
                than the official Doctor Who Society (who, I suspect, may be more about cosplay and waving around sonic
                screwdrivers). All those hours I spent on IMDb were about to pay off. And although the competition was
                friendly, just as I’d seized Jack’s chess crown, I now had my sights on Emma’s <em>Doctor Who Trivial
                Pursuit</em> title. “You can name all of Season One’s episodes? That’s great! I can name them all,” I
                said, trying to sound casual, though I probably didn’t pull it off.
                <br><br>
                Before I knew it, I was put to the test, rattling off all 178 episodes since the 2005 reboot. When I
                finished, everyone chipped in to pay for my meal. Finally, some recognition for all those hours spent
                rewatching and researching.
                <br><br>
                The game only intensified, with more arcane Doctor Who trivia - details I’d picked up after my twentieth
                rewatch of certain episodes or while researching actors, Murray Gold’s scores, and writers on IMDb.
                There were even some classic Who questions, which I aced, thanks to binge-watching Tom Baker’s seasons
                while in Stockholm. If I hadn’t discovered film noir back in January, I’d probably still be working my
                way through Sylvester McCoy’s episodes by now. I suppose I have Humphrey Bogart and Orson Welles to
                thank for interrupting my Whovian marathon.
                <br><br>
                So naturally, I won Trivial Pursuit too, securing a newfound respect from my fellow Hackers. King of the
                Nerds, undisputed. I imagine this is how Sam Spade must have felt after cracking the Maltese Falcon case
                - cool, confident, and holding all the cards. Only in my case, the cards were Doctor Who trivia and Uno.
                As I walked out of Firebug, I just needed a thick fog to roll in, a flickering street lamp, and some
                jazz playing in the background - just a detective wrapping up another case, leaving a trail of awestruck
                witnesses in my wake.<em>“That’s the stuff that dreams are made of.”</em>

            <p>
                You may remember I wrote a detailed account delineating the highs and lows of my erasmus year and
                presented it in <a href="#Nov4">the form of advice</a>. Well, today I checked the Padlet page where all
                the entries were
                submitted and, alas, mine has been omitted entirely, even after my revisions to align it with the
                university’s tone. Sometimes the truth is raw, unpolished and not always what we expected, but
                nevertheless, veracity should be rewarded instead of these congruent narratives which everyone is
                peddling. So that annoyed me more than it probably should have. Particularly, taking into account the
                hours it took me to write all three sections comprehensively.
                <br><br>
                And then, closer to home, it appears a thief walks among us. I began the year with three of each
                utensil, yet now I’m down to a single knife, two spoons, and two forks. One item gone could be an
                accident, a simple misplacement. But this - this is a pattern. There’s no other explanation. I’m sharing
                a space with a cutlery thief. When I catch them in the act, well... let’s just say they may find
                themselves on the wrong end of my remaining knife.

            <p>
                That’s it. I’ve completely finished the coursework section of the course. Submitted the application in
                conjunction with the 4500-word report I hammered out today. It only took eleven hours, but what’s time
                but just a man-made construct to measure the days we’ve passed and... the days we have left, I guess?
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I am both exhausted and, strangely, a little wired. 4500 words. Four-thousand-five-hundred
                words. That’s like… a short novella or a marathon in word form. Or is it? I don’t even know what
                constitutes "a lot of words" anymore because my brain has been processing ideas for so long that
                everything just looks like text and deadlines. Maybe I should submit my report for my writers room
                submission? See how much fun they have learning about Mobile App Development. It’s funny because, for
                the past few hours, I’ve been this mad typing machine, like my fingers were on autopilot. I’m not even
                sure if all of it makes sense, but here’s hoping coherence stuck around through the sleep deprivation.
                <br><br>
                And now that it’s done, I feel this weird mix of accomplishment and aimlessness. Like, what am I
                supposed to do with myself now? I’ve been planning and stressing over this coursework for so long that
                it’s like I’ve forgotten how to not be working on it. Should I take a nap? Binge something mindless? Or
                should I just... sit here and stare at a wall, you know, contemplate existence and how words like “4500”
                and “done” feel good but, like, also anticlimactic? Because that’s where I’m at. I guess I’ll just go to
                bed…

            <p>
                Got my first job interview scheduled. One of the companies who attended the Careers event that I
                mentioned on Thursday are holding interviews the week commencing the 18th. I was aware that they were
                hiring one person to complete a six week summer internship exclusively from DMU so I guess everyone got
                an email saying the same thing. I know it’s inconsequential but it annoys me when the career advisor
                starts the email with ‘Congratulations, you’ve been selected to interview …” intentionally making it
                sound like it was just a handful of us when in reality, everyone who signed up got an opportunity to
                interview. On the day, I even mentioned to the session leader that I had no experience using the tech
                stack which they use so I don’t exactly think that it will be a propitious interview. I guess I can go
                and talk about the broader concepts of Web Development and if I get past the first hurdle, I can learn
                the coding side of the job over Christmas. It’ll be good interview practice regardless.
                <br><br>
                Also, that coursework which I’ve been doing for the past fortnight is due on Monday at 10am in
                conjunction with a report detailing the different components of the app and explaining the
                functionality. The latter part of the assignment completely slipped my mind. It’s 10pm on a Saturday
                night so tomorrow is going to be a busy day writing up everything which we’ve built over the past two
                weeks. Oh my favourite day of the week, soured by the incessant bore of coursework…

            <h2>Friday, 8th November</h2>
            <p>
                I submitted my first submission for the Demon Media magazine today. The deadline is Monday. Because of
                the vast interest in writing, the editor-in-chief has decided to limit the submission to one article per
                person for now. As we move into the second half of the year, it is expected the interest will subside
                and I’ll be able to write a few more per edition. The theme is Winter/Christmas so I wrote an anodyne
                piece on the top ten films to rewatch this year. I’ve included the classics and even snuck in The
                Bishop’s Wife in the honourable mentions section.
                <br><br>
                I’m still interested in taking over the website but I keep getting shrugged off by the head of the Media
                society. The new website was expected ‘imminently’ however that was over a month ago and still no new
                website. I’m at the point where I’m almost sure they are going to keep the same webpage but change the
                stylesheet associated with it. That will satisfy their definition of updating it. Until this happens
                though, I’m going to keep badgering them.
                <br><br>
                This evening I was attending the Demon FM workshop for the new intake of participants. As I’m writing
                this, I’ve just realised that today has been all Demon Media. Either writing for the magazine, editing
                or production training. As I have no intention of doing a radio show - my interest lies in the software
                and hardware - my services have been offered to anyone who needs them. Normally the people who are
                planning their own shows but don’t have the technical know-how to set up the equipment or operate the
                program we use. From what I can see, it is an intuitive system for beginners so it looks like I’ll be in
                high demand when the new schedule kicks off after Christmas for the new shows going on air.
                <br><br>
                Also, a bit of a digression; a student arrived on campus wearing a MAGA cap and began openly endorsing
                some of Trump’s more controversial policies. The situation quickly escalated. By the time campus
                security showed up, the student had a black eye, and there was blood on the pavement. It’ll be
                interesting to see how the university addresses this incident. There was clear provocation, but the
                university’s commitment to maintaining a safe, inclusive environment may take precedence over assigning
                blame. It seems likely they’ll aim to address the incident through the lens of campus safety rather than
                dissecting the motivations behind it.

                DMU Hackers is really starting to heat up. We’ve finally shed the dead weight—the people who only showed
                up for something to add to their CV. Now, we’re diving into more serious topics, like network attacks
                and Linux machine vulnerabilities. Although I’m studying Computer Science, I wouldn’t label myself a
                “hacker.” In IT speak, I’m more of a “coder” within the software development side of things, so I was
                learning new stuff right along with everyone else tonight.
                <br><br>
                Also, this evening, I got an email from a careers advisor. It turns out my name has been mentioned to a
                few employers, including companies in the same circles as JLR and Peregrine. Remember that careers day I
                participated in a <a href="#oct17">few weeks back?</a> Apparently, I made a solid impression, and my CV
                has been making the rounds. I’m not entirely sure I authorised this sharing, but if it leads to a
                graduate position, I might just let the data privacy concerns slide as part of the deal.

            <h2>Wednesday, 6th November</h2>
            <p>
                Celebrations, the coursework is finished. 18:34 to mark the exact time. Dilan and I did a nine hour
                coding session today to hammer it out. Of course, all of my commits were done under Dilan’s scrupulous
                supervision. I would like to say that it was a fifty-fifty split of the workload but that would be
                disingenuous. Actually, when we come to present out application on Monday to our lecturer, that is
                exactly what I’ll be saying but given the enormity of the transgression I made yesterday, (Dilan spent
                much of the day and last night rectifying that mistake whilst I was out enjoying myself at Loftus Road),
                Dilan completed most of the back-end functionality, adapters, list views, database links and error
                checks. What did I do, you might ask. Well, I made it look nice and the User Interface is the most
                important part wouldn’t you say? To put it another way: if we were building a car, Dilan had built the
                engine, chassis, suspension, electrics and transmission, but I turned it from a Mini Cooper into a
                Lamborghini. I feel like I need a lie down. Dilan’s going straight to bed. I suppose he’s deserved it
                after staying up most of the night fixing my errors. Did I mention he’s also got a cold? Poor lad.

            <h2>Tuesday, 5th November</h2>
            <p>
                As the coursework deadline day looms ominously on the horizon, Dilan and I have been tearing through our
                coursework like a bull on steroids. We’re implementing features that are so far beyond the design
                specification that they practically require their own postcode. We’re the dream team. Inimitable and
                original. We don’t just aim for the stars; we’re trying to lasso a comet. (Thank you Mehmet for that
                poetic metaphor). Our work was cruising along like a well-oiled machine, until, in a moment of utter
                brilliance (or perhaps sheer lunacy), I decided to upload a piece of faulty code. You know, the kind of
                code that makes even the most forgiving compiler throw up its virtual hands in despair.
                <br><br>
                To put this into perspective for you non-techies, imagine you’re Mr Blandings, meticulously planning
                your dream home. You’ve got the blueprints all sorted, the silk drapes ordered, and the crystal
                countertops sparkling. Everything’s perfect until I waltz in, muddy boots and all, armed with a
                sledgehammer and a questionable sense of architectural integrity. One swing, and suddenly, you’re not
                standing on your dream oasis anymore. That’s right, I turned your dream house into a pile of rubble
                faster than you can say “renovation nightmare.” You’re shaking your head in disbelief; standing in the
                ruins of what was once your tranquil paradise, now reduced to a chaotic mess of shattered dreams and
                splintered wood. That’s me right now. I broke it. Incorrigibly and irreparable. Like a toddler with a
                crayon in a museum, I’ve left my mark all over our once-glorious project.
                <br><br>
                I’m watching Dilan descend into insanity as he tries to repair my handwork. What would make my
                transgression even worse? Leaving at the pivotal moment to go to London to watch the Boro play. I guess
                I’ve given Dilan something to do whilst I’m away. There’s the common saying that teamwork makes the
                dream work - unless one of the teammates is me … with a sledgehammer.

            <h2>Monday, 4th November</h2>
            <p>
                Today I received an email from Dalia, the DMU Global exchange officer in charge of preparing and
                advising incoming and outgoing exchange students. Her primary role at the moment is persuading current
                students to undertake an Erasmus year for 2025/26 and in order to aid her in her mission, she’s asked
                last year's Erasmus alumni to write their thoughts and perspectives in a forum to show to potential
                candidates. Questioning if I should talk about the fallacies of living abroad or the harsh realities, I
                settled on including some of the points I mentioned in last Wednesday’s blog; opting for veracity rather
                than embellishment.
                <br><br>
                So, the email. I figured it was going to be a <em>‘It would be in your best interests to write something
                positive’</em> type of email after being overtly critical of certain things, but to my surprise, Dalia
                was actually quite pleased with the straightforwardness of my review. What she wasn’t so thrilled about,
                however, was my laissez-faire attitude toward the law. Words like ‘fraudulent’ and ‘expedient’ made
                their way into her critique.
                <br><br>
                She made it abundantly clear that the conclusion needed to be toned down to something more anodyne,
                something the university could stand behind without breaking a sweat. Specifically, she had a problem
                with my closing line: <em>“Remember, nothing’s illegal if you’re foreign.” </em>Apparently, this isn’t
                the kind of stance the university wants to be associated with. Go figure. What happened to freedom of
                Speech? This used to be a respectable country.

            <h2>Sunday, 3nd November</h2>
            <p>
                I love days like today. Absolutely love them. Mornings filled with coding and afternoons packed with
                football and Formula One. It’s a ritual I’ve followed for years, though the company has changed over
                time. Gone are the days when I’d lock myself in my room, tuning out the world. Now, I spend my Sunday
                afternoons at Soar Point – the social hub where sports and quizzes and everything society related is
                based.
                <br><br>
                The atmosphere here is electric on matchdays. When the DMU football teams gather, the three rows of
                tables are reserved giving us the best seats in the house. As expected, they’re a passionate bunch, all
                fervently loyal to their team but there’s always room for humour. Honestly, it’s a miracle the Man Utd
                fans keep coming back, given the relentless banter they endure every week. Also you may remember I
                handed in my resignation from the futsal team a few weeks ago. Well today, I’ve met my replacement.
                Aaron Smith from Cornwall. I couldn’t make it up. The white boy paragon: <em>indie music, The Office,
                crossfit, kitted out in North Face apparel, and overusing phrases like “oh my gosh”</em>. I’ll let you
                make your own conclusions.
                <br><br>
                Once the football winds down, it’s time for classic pub grub - and not the bacteria on toast I
                half-expect at some places. We’re talking juicy burgers, crispy chicken kievs, cheesy pizzas - the kind
                of comfort food that even my picky appetite can’t resist.
                <br><br>
                Once the football fans clear out, the Karting and Racing societies flood in, eager to claim the newly
                vacated seats. The atmosphere stays just as charged, especially this week with the chaos of the
                Brazilian Grand Prix. The unpredictable weather turned what should have been a straightforward
                ninety-minute race into a two-and-a-half-hour epic, complete with cars spinning off track, safety car
                interventions, and red flags galore.
                <br><br>
                Most of the boys here are die-hard McLaren fans, and for them, Lando Norris is the local hero. With
                Norris starting on pole and Max Verstappen all the way down in seventeenth, it felt inevitable that the
                gap in the Driver’s Championship standings would shrink to just 25 points. A thrilling prospect, and the
                tension was palpable.
                <br><br>
                But in true Formula One fashion, everything unravelled. The McLaren strategy left everyone frustrated,
                and when Max pulled off the drive of his career to take the win, drinks went flying in frustration, a
                spectacular show of collective disappointment. Yet, in the midst of all the drama, Alpine quietly
                secured an impressive second and third place. Not that anyone here really noticed—or cared, for that
                matter.
                <br><br>
                And that’s it. Another perfect Sunday concluded. Admittedly, some weekends are better than others based
                on external factors such as whether it was a successful week in Fantasy or if I’ve got a headstart on
                the coming week's lectures. Nevertheless, today was a good day.

            <h2>Saturday, 2nd November</h2>
            <p>
                It’s Bonfire Night. Normally not something I would go out of my way for however, a rare stroke of
                fortune had earned me a ticket. A little caveat of winning was the dubious pleasure of being a chaperone
                for the group of exchange students from all corners of the university. It seemed that fate (or, in more
                practical terms, the raffle drum) had decreed I be here. Otherwise, I’d have been watching the F1
                qualifying and trying to complete my coursework so really this was a grand procrastination excursion.
                <br><br>
                Daria, the perpetually cheerful Exchange Liaison who I met at the meeting on Wednesday, was already
                herding our diverse flock when I arrived. The group was eclectic, with students from various faculties
                and from all over the globe. I spoke to a large number of them about what drew them to Leicester and for
                most, the answer was, they wanted to be in the UK - anywhere in the UK. A couple of them had travelled
                from Stockholm University, and in a twist of serendipity, they actually shared my general cynicism about
                university administration. It was a relief, honestly. Usually, conversations in these settings spiral
                into small talk about weather, coursework, or travel itineraries, but here were people willing to engage
                in what I’d call my “status quo grievances.” We had a lively discussion, which made the whole affair
                feel less forced. Shared disillusionment has a way of bringing people together, doesn’t it?
                <br><br>
                Bonfire Night was held in Abbey Park, but the whole event had morphed into something almost
                unrecognisable from my childhood. I remember when this night was simpler: kids running around with
                sparklers, their eyes wide with wonder. Back then, it was a neighbourhood affair—a yearly ritual where
                community spirit briefly overshadowed everything else. Now, the event felt industrialised, swallowed up
                by consumerism. A £30 entry fee for what was essentially an amusement park. Food trucks lined the area,
                fairground rides rattled the ground beneath our feet, and LED-light wands were being sold to eager and
                impressionable kids. A live band played on the periphery, adding to the spectacle. Thankfully, I got in
                for free, because my frugal nature doesn’t consider this kind of extravagance a luxury worth paying for.
                <br><br>
                Still, I made use of the situation. With my camera, I captured moments both mundane and magical. The
                bonfire itself, a towering inferno crackling against the night sky, made for some striking shots.
                Fireworks splintered into bursts of colour, and for a fleeting second, it almost made me forget about
                the looming coursework deadlines hanging over me. Almost. There were genuine moments of joy, especially
                among the exchange students, and I found myself appreciating the odd patch of laughter or the sudden
                gasp of delight when the sky exploded into fractals of light.
                <br><br>
                The event was sprawling, drawing a crowd of what must have been close to 10,000 people. Despite this, or
                perhaps because chaos favours coincidence, I managed to run into Nat and Mehmet. It’s funny how that
                happens, isn’t it? A field filled with strangers, and yet two friends materialise right in front of you.
                Nat was, predictably, carrying a giant cup of overpriced hot chocolate, while Mehmet complained about
                the “atrocious” music selection. To be fair, I agree with him. We shared some laughs, our critiques of
                the night interwoven with genuine moments of camaraderie. Mehmet, in his usual theatrical fashion,
                declared that this was “all a load of bollocks” while simultaneously stealing marshmallows from a nearby
                stand when the vendor’s back was turned. I’m starting to like him more and more.
                <br><br>
                As the night wore on, I found myself conflicted. Bonfire Night wasn’t what it used to be, but perhaps it
                wasn’t meant to be. Traditions change, evolve, and are often co-opted by the ever-hungry machine of
                consumer culture. Yet, I found a kind of solace in the unexpected: a group of exchange students, a
                couple of like-minded cynics from Stockholm, and friends reappearing in a field lit up by fire and
                noise. Maybe, despite my gripes and my instinct to critique, the night had something to offer after all.
                Or maybe I’m just grasping at straws, trying to give meaning to a night I didn’t really want to attend.
                Who knows? Either way, I got some good photos out of it.
                <br><br>
                Also, trying to explain the importance of Bonfire night to international students is harder than I
                thought. Yes, I told them the tale about Guy Fawkes trying to destroy parliament to remove Protestant
                rule and replace it with Catholic leadership. But why do we celebrate this? We don’t celebrate the last
                person to be hanged in this country by selling miniature hanging sets and tying mannequins up with a
                noose. That’s the great thing about getting people from other cultures coming to England. They look at
                our traditions with a fresh perspective and can discover just how bizarre they are to outsiders. I can’t
                wait to hear their views on Panto season.

                One deadline down, another one in seven days. This one involves programming a functioning application so
                everything could go wrong. I’ve been staring at the same ninety lines of code, perplexed at why they
                won’t run. I’ve approached the problem every way I can think of and yet, I’m still hitting errors. I’ve
                been here for so long that I am wanting to drop the module. Surely, I can just <em>live off the
                land</em>
                like George and Lennie dreamt of; away from technology and programming languages. Or do Workaway

                Ten

            <h2>Thursday, 31st October</h2>
            <p>
                Today, I had the fantastic opportunity to join a BBC Writers Room Zoom call—a Q&A about what to expect
                for their upcoming Open Call. For a full month, the BBC Writers Room opens its submission portal to
                anyone with a story to tell. This means writers of all backgrounds can submit scripts for TV dramas,
                radio plays, comedies, children’s shows, and more. The BBC will then review every submission, seeking
                promising voices to nurture and develop into accomplished writers. The selection process is highly
                competitive, but it’s an incredible chance to break into the industry. I’d be remiss not to give it a
                shot by submitting one of my own stories and seeing where it might lead.
                <br><br>
                Before I think about which story I’m submitting, I’ve got to proofread my 4000 word case analysis before
                tomorrow's midday deadline. It is 99% finished; I just need to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Once
                that’s out the way, I can focus on building our coffee shop mobile application before the deadline next
                weekend. Dilan has almost finished the front end features, so I need to catch up to complete the admin
                side of things. I’ve also been assigned the task of writing the documentation also because ‘I have a way
                with words’.
                <br><br>
                One of the topics which came up yesterday at the exchange debrief was the Abbey Park Bonfire taking
                place on Saturday night. It’s normally £30 but I received an email this afternoon from DMUGlobal stating
                that I have won a ticket in the raffle. There are twenty-four of us going in total - a mix of DMU
                students and incoming exchange students so Amena has warned me to be on my best behaviour. I think this
                was a tacit reminder to not scare off the new intake, which is ironic considering it’s the one time of
                year where scares are permitted. That should be something to look forward to in any case. I have a few
                new tricks I want to try out with my camera after getting private lessons from a new friend from the
                media society who is doing photography as part of her course.

                We’re on fire! Literally. We were told upon moving in that if the fire alarm were ever to sound for
                longer than two minutes, it is not a drill. Because I’m sceptical by nature, probably a hindrance rather
                than a strength in this scenario, I waited for five minutes before deciding to head out. I knew it was
                for real by the panicked countenance of the staff; all lining up on the other side of the road with
                their matching high-vis jackets on, trying to herd everyone to the end of the road. I didn’t stick
                around because I had the Erasmus debrief at the campus. This was an opportunity for everyone who had
                attended a University abroad, to catch up, exchange stories, and ultimately try to make everyone jealous
                about their chosen city so how could I resist. Little did I know that it would be me that was made
                jealous.
                <br><br>
                It was a small gathering. Intimate enough for everyone to be heard. There were some faces which I
                recognised from the departure meetings and some new who were just brimming with mirth to share their
                anecdotes. Hearing their tales made me realise just how unfulfilled my time abroad was. I could list my
                excuses; the campus was outside of the city, I was the only Englishman in the faculty, there were no
                societies or clubs specifically for erasmus students. The list could go on, but I have to accept that
                the
                main problem was me. I tried to be approachable and gregarious. Going on museum trips with people from
                my accommodation, I played futsal as frequently as I could in the Sports centre. I met plenty of people
                but most/all remained just passing acquaintances. My only faithful companion was my shadow, but even he
                left during the four months of snow and saturnine weather.
                <br><br>
                I don’t think this was all my fault. The herd mentality of the Germans or the piss-poor organisation of
                events by Stockholm University didn’t help but rather hindered my involvement throughout the year. This
                may be a weak vindication, but it doesn’t change the fact that if it wasn’t for futsal, I could have
                completed the course from my room in Darlington. What was I supposed to say when asked about the great
                things I did? The winter started in early November and didn’t end till late March, so I stayed in my
                room
                watching Film Noir. When the sun came out again in the Spring, I was counting down the days till it was
                over. I did go travelling to the surrounding countries which is memorable but what sort of advertisement
                is that for my year in Stockholm. ‘The best thing I did was leave to explore other places’.
                <br><br>
                I felt a profound emptiness watching others revel in the experiences I had hoped to share. How different
                it all would have been had I gained admission to my first choice in Charleston, South Carolina. What
                aggravates me most is the absurdity of my own decision-making: I am studying Spanish - SO WHY DIDN’T I
                GO TO FUCKING SPAIN. That was, quite possibly, the greatest opportunity I’ll ever have to immerse
                myself. My rationale at the time was that Deusto University in Bilbao was my only option, a city I’d
                already visited. But truly, did that matter? Tilly, a girl in the debrief, spent the year in Barcelona
                and now she is almost fluent in Spanish.
                <br><br>
                I get incredibly depressed when I reminisce. Such a great opportunity spurned. Was it the place, the
                people or me? Whatever it was, it’s over now. It’s on my degree. I just wished I had better memories
                associated with my time away. Fun anecdotes which I could share. People who I’ve kept in touch with.
                Instead, I’m left with embellishments and fantasies that mask the reality of that year: the course was
                online, the people were distant, and the city was cold.
                <br><br>
                To try and find some positives from the meeting; I met some cool new people who are worldly and
                intrepid. We also met with the first group of incoming exchange students studying at DMU for the first
                semester. Masking my dejection, I played the part we were expected to play and welcomed the new students
                with warmth and excitement though I felt like I wanted to be a million miles away.
                <br><br>
                Also, St Martin’s House is still standing so I assume it was only a small conflagration.

            <h2>Tuesday, 29th October</h2>
            <p>
                Do dreams signify anything real? That was the discussion at the magazine meeting this evening.
                Horoscopes, tea leaves, dreams - I tend to fall on the side of science. Premonitions and out-of-body
                experiences are purely chemical reactions that are interpreted as something ethereal due to external
                factors. Dreams are just your subconscious stringing together random thoughts and populating them with
                real people or locations. Excuse my incredulity, but solipsism will get me much further in life than the
                belief in mythical or ostensible pantheons. My philosophical stance, which holds that one’s own mind is
                the only certainty, should convey my scepticism regarding this sort of thing, but I am not here to
                convert others to my pessimistic beliefs. If they want to assign credence and meaning to dreams - even
                though they lack empirical support - I will indulge them.
                <br><br>
                Maybe it’s because none of my dreams are meaningful or remotely insightful. Real life isn’t like the
                movies, where one has a dream and then changes their entire life; goes travelling, gets married, starts
                a majestic new journey. Nope, mine are much more tangible. The only epiphany I’ve had, which came to me
                in a dream, is the realisation that university was the only way out of the rut I found myself in four
                years ago.
                <br><br>
                What does it mean when dreamers fixate on a single person? A dear friend, a lost loved one - do these
                dreams whisper secrets from our subconscious, inviting us to explore a reality that exists only in the
                playground of our minds? I find myself greeting my granddad every now and then. It’s not a
                heart-wrenching reunion where I’m painfully reminded of his absence, nor a prophetic vision that warns
                me of what’s to come. No, it’s a simple acknowledgment, a moment where I can picture him standing side
                by side with Nana. In those dreams, I softly whisper, “It’s good to see you again,” cherishing the
                fleeting connection that binds us beyond the veil of reality. Even if it is just a wave of chemicals, a
                surge of neurons firing in the night, I wake up feeling comforted by the memories that linger.
                <br><br>
                The afterlife isn’t a notion I readily embrace, but I refuse to diminish the hopes of those who do. In
                moments of quiet reflection, I can’t help but wonder about what lies beyond this life. My time here
                feels precious, a gift I want to savour fully. I hold on to the belief that time is fleeting, that what
                will be will be. And in that understanding, I strive to make every moment count, finding meaning in the
                little things.

            <p>
                Woke up to a wonderful email this morning - which is a nice change from the ominous, incessant reminders
                of coursework deadlines as per usual. I’m off to Paris! A DMUGlobal opportunity themed around
                employability and team building skills. I must confess, my ulterior motive is to see the sights. I have
                been known to throw a sickie from time to time to have an adventure around London so I may deploy these
                similar tactics whilst in Paris too! <em>I always get a 24 hour flu around April anyway. </em> Paris has
                been on my itinerary for a while and this gives me the perfect opportunity to see the sights on the
                university’s dime. During the DMUGlobal trip to Bilbao in 2021, there were several people ostensibly
                suffering from heat stroke therefore remained in their rooms for two or three days. Yep - I was dubious
                about their excuses too. Paris however, is much larger than Bilbao and I only have a meagre five days to
                cover everything. I won’t have time for university organised activities - not with my full itinerary.

            <h2>Sunday, 27th October</h2>
            <p>
                I just had one of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever experienced. Compared to the strident environment
                of the hostel, even my springy mattress felt like an upgrade. With two days off work, I had to race
                against the clock to catch up on the progress Dilan had made in our coursework. We’ve exchanged our Case
                Analysis essays to peer review each other’s work before the Friday deadline. Dilan’s expertise is firmly
                rooted in coding—he knows the concepts inside and out—but translating those ideas into academic
                vernacular is not his strong suit. It took me over two hours to decipher his work and shape it into a
                cohesive paper. His draft was weighed down with superfluous detail and language that felt too casual for
                an academic setting. Meanwhile, I have a whole lexicon of words I rarely use, like “good enough” or “a
                lot of.” Words like “efficient” and “plethora” feel far more mellifluous. It makes me appreciate the
                writing journey I’ve been on over the years because I know I once wrote just like Dilan—expressing ideas
                without much thought for verbiage or a skill for succinct language.

            <h2>Saturday, 26th October</h2>
            <p>
                It’s 2:20 AM, and as I write this, I’m listening to the falsetto snores coming from the other bunks.
                Each snorer sings at a different octave, slightly out of rhythm with the others. I can actually monitor
                which part of their sleep cycles they are in by the intermission of their snores, which is not helpful
                for getting back to sleep. I long for sleep, but my mind remains vigilant, refusing to rest in the
                darkness. Since there is no hope of relief until my comrades in the trenches move into their non-REM
                sleep patterns, let me tell you about my day.
                <br><br>
                The first problem I encountered was all the trains getting cancelled due to signalling issues. <em>The
                sooner labour nationalise the railways, the bloody better.</em> Only one train was departing for London,
                so a
                hundred passengers were rushing for a spot or a seat if you’re one of the lucky ones. I was on my way to
                the Capital and that’s all I could ask for.
                <br><br>
                Making it to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane with minutes to spare, I took my seat and witnessed one of the
                most inquisitive conversations I have ever seen about Shakespeare. I initially misunderstood the format
                of the interview; Greg Doran is not the host but the interviewee next to David Tennant. Given his vast
                portfolio of plays and productions - and his book to sell - it became evident that Tennant was only
                there primarily for marketing purposes. Starting as an actor, Doran moved into directing in the '90s and
                has since completed Shakespeare productions from all three folios. If it were an interview with just
                him, it would have still been intriguing but due to his backstage role, his reputation does not garner
                the same respect as David’s. But what a man. Full of anecdotes and wit. A truly-talented raconteur with
                a penchant for storytelling. I am more inclined to see one of his productions from observing the talent
                and discernment he has in approaching Shakespeare.
                <br><br>
                Next to me was a girl named Mary-Jane, a history major who just graduated from Edinburgh University. We
                shared stories and our Shakespeare favourites. Congenial people coming together to share an
                experience—this is what I imagine Comic-Con is like. Everyone with the same passions in the same room.
                However, I must say that the theatre looked half-empty, possibly due to the train cancellations.
                Covertly snapping a few photographs at the curtain call, I was pleased I moved my train forward a day to
                accommodate this interview.
                <br><br>
                ***
                <br><br>
                I may have just witnessed some of the best performances of my life. The intensity, the foreboding, the
                raw passion of a Shakespeare aficionado - it all left me in awe. I had forgotten how profoundly dark
                Macbeth can be, but this production brought that darkness to life with majestic power. The script stayed
                true, almost verbatim, to the second folio. The emotions felt raw and genuine, with tears as real as
                Macduff's searing vengeance against Macbeth. These are the Shakespearian greats which we are witnessing
                and their resonance is unparalleled.
                <br><br>
                This adaptation brought its own ingenuity to the performance by having the audience wear headphones
                throughout. This allowed us to hear the witches' cackles and howls directly, bypassing the challenges of
                portraying them on stage. Each actor wore a microphone, enabling them to whisper their monologues, so
                the pain and intensity in their voices didn’t need to be projected across the theatre. The Celtic
                overtones of the performance remained true to its Scottish roots, while an added ecclesiastical edge
                made the experience even more ominous, with the sounds of disconcerting whispers playing directly in our
                ears.
                <br><br>
                This adaptation left me with a sense of awe and a renewed appreciation for the power of theatre. The
                intimacy of the whispered lines and the eerie soundscapes drew me into the world of Macbeth like never
                before, making me feel as though I was right there amidst the turmoil and tragedy. It was a reminder of
                why I love Shakespeare—his ability to explore the depths of human emotion in ways that still resonate
                today. As I walked away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had witnessed something special, something
                that would stay with me long after the final echo of the witches’ cackle had faded.

            <h2>Friday, 25th October</h2>
            <p>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it’s back to London I go. With my student loans to fund the shows, heigh-ho,
                heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
                <br><br>
                That’s right. Back to the citadel. Why? Because Shakespeare demands it. <em>Thus fate, that hath made me
                    servant to it,</em> leads me back to the Globe. Tonight, I am watching the penultimate matinee of
                The Taming
                of the Shrew at the Globe Theatre; the final show of the season before the future productions move
                indoors to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. I’m going to be well wrapped up, for the cold October air can be
                unforgiving when permeating the Wooden O. (Shakespeare described the Globe as the Wooden O in Henry V).
                <br><br>
                But that’s not all. No disrespect to Petruchio and Katherina, but their love quarrel doesn’t warrant a
                trip to London by themselves. No, no, no—the pièce de résistance starts this afternoon with the first of
                two parts of my David Tennant extravaganza. I am watching an interview at the Royal Drury Theatre hosted
                by venerated Shakespeare impresario, Greg Doran interviewing the tenth doctor himself. This is in
                addition to their ongoing run of Macbeth which I’m seeing tomorrow. The King of Scotland, played by
                David Tennant, supported by Cush Jumbo starts at two pm. I have been flirting with these tickets for
                months until one glorious day a few weeks ago where the last minute tickets were released at cut-rate
                prices. Low enough for me to justify the purchase. <em>And so let the wind grow cold and the night creep
                    upon us; let the curtain rise on this thrilling adventure, and so, with eager hearts, we step boldly
                    into the night, where our destinies await!</em>
                <br><br>
                PS. I am staying in a hostel for the first time in my life where I will be sharing my room with three
                other people like a common peasant. If I haven’t published a blog by Sunday evening detailing my trip,
                come looking for me. I’m staying at the Astor Hyde Park Hostel. <em>Please save me . . .</em>
                <br><br>
                ***
                <br><br>
                This evening marked my second trip to the Globe Theatre in as many weeks. Taming of the Shrew is one of
                the few works in Shakespeare's body of work that hasn’t been significantly altered to align with
                contemporary themes of female empowerment and social justice. I won’t provide a full analysis here, as
                most of you may not be interested, but I will publish my review elsewhere. I will say that it was a
                slight disappointment compared to the high expectations I had. The culmination of the play didn’t match
                the anodyne tone established throughout, leaving me feeling unfulfilled. For a comedy, it relied too
                heavily on modern contemporary language for laughs rather than on the nuanced Shakespearean lexicon from
                the script.
                <br><br>
                The journey to South Kensington was uneventful, yet a sense of trepidation coursed through me as tales
                of hostel living raced through my mind. The hostel felt somewhat incongruous given its surroundings. The
                street is lined with foreign embassies and law-firms, high-end real estates and Imperial College London
                sharing the same pathways. Just around the corner stands the Royal Albert Hall, a major landmark steeped
                in London’s history. In stark contrast to its elegant neighbours, the Astor hostel shares an imposing
                façade but lacks the decorous opulence within.
                <br><br>
                Friday night in a hostel has more in common with a nightclub than a hotel. The common room is a chaotic
                scene, littered with beer pong tables and DJ decks in the corner. There are spills, thrills, and even
                some pills being passed among travellers. The alcohol-stained wooden floors make every step a sticky
                ordeal. Couples are canoodling on the stairs—apparently, a quick way to get to know the locals—and I
                find myself stepping over something I’d rather not think about as I try to make my way to my room.
                <br><br>
                The room itself is sparse, furnished only with bunk beds. I’m sharing the space with three others—Till,
                Kenny, and Nuno, according to the labels on their bunks. I was ready for bed by midnight; I kept my
                belongings close, slept in my clothes, and looped my backpack strap around my wrist. My parents taught
                me to be vigilant, to trust no one. I might be crafty in seizing opportunities, but I’m not a thief. As
                for these travellers? I don’t know their stories. Come first light, I’ll be out of here like a whippet.

            <h2>Thursday, 24th October</h2>
            <p>
                It’s hacking time! Last week was the last taster session for DMU hackers which means this week is
                exclusively for members only. Those of us who are serious about the subject. Being a final year student
                I have a quasi knowledge base surrounding the topics we will be covering. This evening, we were starting
                off easy by introducing the Linux operating system to the newbies. We were all beginners at some point
                so we need to be patient with them. Because I’m not part of the committee, I don’t need to help these
                neophytes out so I spent my time developing a brute force algorithm which can crack passwords in less
                than thirty seconds. Sounds impressive, but the real impetus is a bit more mundane—I forgot my Airbnb
                password, and I’ll need it soon.
                <br><br>
                After the session, it’s off to Soar Point, the student pub that’s the hub of society socials. I’m
                involved in so many societies this year that I never enter the pub without finding at least one group I
                can comfortably join. Tonight, I spent the first half hour with my fellow coders, debating whether
                Blockchain is overrated and if the moon landing could have been more efficient had the software been
                built on open-source foundations. I bet your curiosity is almost palpable.
                <br><br>
                After that, I joined the Racing team for a few quick pub games before settling down with Mehmet to watch
                Fenerbahçe vs. Man Utd. As kickoff approached, more of his Turkish friends joined us, each one welcomed
                into the fold. It wasn’t until we left that I found out some of them were complete strangers. This is
                what I missed in Stockholm: a welcoming group of Englishmen where we could catch up and enjoy our home
                away from home. Instead, I was the only Brit in the Computer Science faculty there, and a social pariah
                among the Germans. <em>I probably shouldn’t have made those war jokes.</em>
                <br><br>
                Surrounded by a dozen Turks, I knew they were passionate supporters, famous for setting off flares and
                chanting fiercely back home. It was no surprise when that same fervour filled Soar Point as Fenerbahçe
                scored, their rich footballing heritage coming alive in every cheer and shout. This is football at its
                finest. It was a stark contrast to the women’s game I watched in the pub a few weeks ago, where two men
                were escorted out for their overly enthusiastic behaviour.

                The second day of the careers fair was just as informative as I’d hoped. It offered a chance for a
                face-to-face with sectors beyond the IT realm, allowing me to explore whether I have transferable skills
                that might align with them. One opportunity that truly piqued my interest was a selection of advertising
                firms—billed as "1001 jobs under one roof." Their graduate schemes offer training across a wide range of
                fields, including writing, media, software, animation, and various other areas of production. Hitherto,
                I hadn't considered opportunities outside of Software Development or related IT roles, but I must admit,
                the prospect of applying is quite tempting.
                <br><br>
                Alongside the multitude of advertising firms, the automotive industry made a strong showing at the fair.
                High-end brands like Bentley and Aston Martin drew large crowds, much of which seemed driven by the
                allure of working for such prestigious names. However, according to my friends in engineering, unless
                you’re joining at a senior or managerial level, it’s often more advantageous to start with a more
                approachable brand like Mini or Volkswagen.
                <br><br>
                The demand for data scientists is strong, especially vis-a-vis software engineering roles—these
                companies seek experts who can monitor telemetry, uncover patterns, and enhance UI/UX. Ironically, many
                of these automotive giants have their headquarters in Milton Keynes, which discourages some from making
                the move. As for me, I consider myself adaptable and would relocate wherever opportunity calls.

                It’s crunch time. The case analysis has been released as well as the coding coursework. I have a
                fortnight to complete both which is achievable but it does mean it’s going to be a long two weeks. The
                case analysis is simple. 4000 words delineating the ethics challenges of a fictitious company. (I have
                already completed 2000 words in three days.) The coursework is proving to be more tortuous, especially
                because I am paired with Dilan who wants to program it so it is compatible with the Starship Enterprise.
                My issue isn’t keeping up with the lectures and labs, it’s keeping up with Dilan’s vision for this
                project. Nevertheless, it’s going to be the most advanced exercise on my portfolio regardless.
                <br><br>
                I am also prescient about what I want to be doing after university. Graduate schemes and apprenticeships
                are all being released in the coming weeks; therefore, the first careers fair of the season kicked off
                today. The companies that hosted the event last week were among those invited today. Peregrine, JLR, and
                Caterpillar all recognised me from those activities and strongly urged—using their exact vernacular—that
                I apply for their vacancies. Does it count as being headhunted if I am approached during a recruitment
                event? Nevertheless, I updated my CV yesterday in preparation. Some deadlines are as early as November
                1st, so it’s going to be a busy few weeks.

                This evening, I had to break the bad news to the Futsal team that I’d have to retire from the season
                before our first match. Why? Well, because my overly-scheduled timetable can’t accommodate the intense
                futsal schedule. The room went silent. There were looks of disbelief and incredulity all around, like
                I’d just announced that I was actually an alien in disguise.
                <br><br>
                “Wait, what do you mean you’re quitting?” someone blurted out. I couldn’t give them the real reason so I
                fabricated an injury. The audacity of it. The betrayal. Why would anyone want to quit football? They
                couldn’t understand why the guy they nicknamed ‘Cole Palmer’ would want to focus on other things.
                Meanwhile, the coach’s face looked like he’d just bitten into a lemon. More annoyed than disappointed, I
                could almost see the gears turning in his head: Great, the diversity hire has just quit my team. I bet
                he’s thinking that. I’ll find out for sure when I meet my replacement—probably some guy named Charles
                who plays lacrosse and ultimate frisbee. Goes hiking on a weekend and drives a Subaru Outback with a
                mountain bike strapped to the roof. What a tit.
                <br><br>
                After some awkward goodbyes and a half-hearted “Stay in touch!” (which we all knew wouldn’t happen), I
                snuck upstairs to my Pilates class. As I lay on my mat, trying to channel my inner peace and hold a
                bridge pose, I couldn’t help but contemplate my decisions. This is for the best. It’s my final year and
                I do have plenty of other commitments which I want to focus on. Writing for the Magazine, producing for
                the Demon FM, designing and developing the car components, attending Hack-a-thons with the Hackers. This
                is the best for the long run. At least I hope it is.

                I finished reading the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath; the only full length novel published under her nom de
                plume Victoria Lucas, a few months before her death in 1963. Historically, it’s categorised as a
                semi-autobiographical novel as Plath took inspiration from her own time spent in mental institutions and
                embellished the tales of her acquaintances from that time. I’m incredulous how no one knew she was
                suicidal given the tell-tale signs in her work. Most of her short stories follow the same depressive
                theme and include suicide or self-harm. If that wasn’t a salient hint, most are written in first person.
                She was literally transcribing her own pain and no one looked past the facade of her fictitious stories.
                The Bell Jar was particularly appealing for me because of the 50s setting which came with esoteric
                references which I am proud to say I understood. Sydney Greenstreet, Gloria Grahame, Shelley Winters.
                Thank you Film Noir.

                Switching from the macabre subject of Sylvia Plath to the exciting prospects of a trip to Paris, I have
                submitted my application for the cultural integration and employability trip taking place in early
                Spring. The deadline is Monday but since the case studio deadline for my coursework is in a fortnight, I
                don’t want any other distractions. Between now and then, I have applications which I want to submit for
                JLR, and a couple other companies from the careers day on Thursday. I have only just started my final
                year but most internship and graduate programs for the summer close their applications in the coming
                months so I need to keep on top of that as well.

                My affinity for new experiences continued with the first session of Demon FM held in the campus
                broadcasting studio. Backed by the DSU and the media faculty, I’m amazed by the apparent indifference
                toward the society, especially given all the amazing equipment we have at our disposal—cameras, sound
                gear, TV broadcasting decks, and everything needed to send signals out into the world. This raises some
                doubts about the activities and management structure, but for now, I’m keeping an open mind to all the
                information being shared.
                <br><br>
                I was especially eager for this evening’s session after enduring four long hours of seminars on computer
                ethics. My mind had wandered through a labyrinth of jargon and legalese, each term more tedious than the
                last. It felt like the life had been drained from the room, leaving behind a dull echo of buzzwords and
                ethical dilemmas that seemed to spiral into an abyss of ambiguity. Yawn. Normally, I wouldn’t approach
                any part of a module with apathy, but I have already completed two modules dedicated to computer ethics
                during my tenure at De Montfort.
                <br><br>
                The only positive from enduring this academic purgatory was getting a rundown of the case study which
                accounts for 20% of our grade for this module: a 4000 word essay delineating the challenges and
                opportunities a fictitious start-up faces when trying to balance innovation with ethics. Simple enough.
                I get a certain Joie de vivre as Delboy would say, from writing essays but I feel like my penmanship is
                being curtailed by others who use AI to complete their essays. It is hard to discern excellence if every
                essay is of the same quality. That leads to a sea of mediocrity. My writing is NOT mediocre, but
                compared to the omniscience abilities of ChatGPT, my verisimilitude will be punished.

                Life unfolds in chapters, each one offering a chance for change, growth, and sometimes, an unexpected
                shift in the narrative. Just as a story builds with each new scene, so does the character of a
                person—moulded by moments of challenge, introspection, and the subtle pressures that shape our responses
                to the world. We begin as one version of ourselves, clinging to familiar roles, but life has a way of
                pushing us into new acts, whether we are ready or not. These turning points, often disguised as ordinary
                days, reveal how far we've come from the people we once were, and hint at the potential of who we might
                become.
                <br><br>
                In the last three years alone, I have left home, started university, conquered my fear of flying, and
                lived in a foreign country. The list of fears and anxieties that had plagued me for so long has
                diminished with every passing year, leaving only one solitary fear left. Though I am not free of this
                burden, I understand the importance of acknowledging this vast journey—recognizing the introvert I was
                and the person I’ve become. Today, on an ordinary day like any other, an opportunity presented itself in
                the form of a careers event hosted by JLR (Jaguar Land Rover), offering a chance to reflect on this
                transformation.
                <br><br>
                The event began with an informal Q&A designed to inspire, as the tagline suggested, but unfortunately,
                it quickly gave way to a sense of ennui. Alas, although some parts were informative and interesting, the
                hour-long advertisement for the company felt unnecessarily prolonged and could have been shortened to a
                succinct fifteen-minute presentation.. The following two hours was a coalition of tasks and exercises
                which were part of JLR’s employment process to give us short tasters on the joys to expect if we apply
                for entry level/graduate roles.
                <br><br>
                We were divided into three groups, rotating through the different tasks. Curiously, the majority of my
                peers hailed from Cyber Security rather than Software Development or Computer Science, which was odd,
                given that none of the available graduate programmes catered to their background. The exercises were
                largely focused on soft skills—the kind that are crucial in most professions—though each task was
                modelled after real components from JLR’s past application processes.
                <br><br>
                One of the tasks required us to give a ten-minute presentation as a team, focusing on the future of
                electric vehicles and what innovations we could bring to JLR. As is typical in situations where
                strangers are forced to collaborate, everyone initially avoided eye contact, busied themselves with
                their phones, and waited for someone else to take the lead. I can’t stand these moments; it would be so
                much easier if everyone just communicated openly and tackled the task head-on. Assuming the role of
                project manager, I spearheaded the conversation into a productive discussion. Eventually, we settled on
                a few safe, pragmatic ideas—concepts that other luxury brands had already implemented, ensuring we
                wouldn’t stray too far from familiar territory.
                <br><br>
                Delivering these ideas with a sense of confidence and ease is a skill that many lack, often because it’s
                simply not emphasised in public schools. This is one reason why so many politicians and CEOs thrive in
                their fields—class and background play a significant role. The basics of clear speech and proper
                enunciation are foundational to public speaking, but my team struggled with these. Hearing our ideas
                relayed in a monotone mumble felt almost painful, lacking the energy and conviction that a strong pitch
                requires.
                <br><br>
                Then it was my turn. I could liken myself to Thomas Skinner in the delivery of my pitch, but I’ll
                refrain. The task was meant to simulate a direct pitch to JLR departments, but I treated it like a sales
                opportunity, crafting my delivery to convey the lifestyle and essence of a Jaguar owner. I emphasised
                the opulence and class associated with the brand, painting a vivid picture for the audience before
                seamlessly tying it back to user experience and the comfort of Jaguar’s electric vehicles. It was
                beautiful. Smooth, confident, engaging. I couldn’t have done it any better if I had tried.
                <br><br>
                After my performance in the presentation and spearheading the discussions on the subsequent tasks, I was
                approached by Nuri, a representative of JLR, to gauge my interest in the graduate schemes. Explaining
                that I was an aspiring Software Developer, he lamented explaining the difficulties of achieving that
                role without a masters degree. He went on to expound the perks and benefits of working in project
                management. He emphasised how my strengths—generating ideas, steering discussions, and creating a
                positive atmosphere—would serve me well in that field, and his feedback gave me pause to reflect on
                skills I hadn’t fully recognized in myself before.
                <br><br>
                Mmm, interesting. Before today, I was ignorant that I possessed this specific skill set so my sceptical
                demeanour is telling me that I must have just been with some extremely laconic people for these tasks
                instead of being an exceptional leader. But perhaps there’s more to this than I initially thought—maybe
                I’ve been underestimating my potential in areas outside of software development.
                <br><br>
                Irrespective of this positive introspection, I think it is beneficial to acknowledge what I’ve learnt,
                not just about the careers available but that I have grown as a person. Despite my reservations of the
                successes of my Erasmus year, my implicit assimilation of these soft skills has been put to the test
                this afternoon and I have surprised myself at my capabilities.
                <br><br>
                It was clear that I was no longer the passive participant I once was. Instead, I had become someone who
                could navigate the complexities of group dynamics, articulate thoughts under pressure, and most
                surprisingly, bring out the best in those around me. The introverted neophyte, the part I was once so
                comfortable to play, has outgrown me, making way to a new character. The start of a new Act. May
                tomorrow yield the same bright torch as today.

                My neck is better which is fortunate because I have the Racing team meeting and the Demon Media Magazine
                workshops today. Both were semi-introductory events with the Racing society proving to be more popular
                on the day. There are two meetings, I’ve since found out. One for the casual learners like myself, and a
                dedicated meeting for the mechanical engineers who are obliged to partake in the workshop elements as
                part of their final year project. The team leader is as stereotypical as you might think with sponsored
                polo shirts and a brummie accent. He can’t be much older than me which undermines his authority in the
                workshop.
                <br><br>
                Demon media magazine was a short and succinct session outlining the format of the latest edition and the
                scheduling around it. We are working towards the Winter edition which is due to be released in early
                December. The categories are open ended meaning we can write about almost anything and they will
                publish. This laissez-faire attitude is what makes the previous releases seem disjointed and
                unprofessional. Pick a niche and dedicate the magazine to it instead of mixing a creative writing
                publication with a political satire overview. Personally, it doesn’t make sense to me but it’s not my
                place to dictate over. The elections for editor-in-chief are due to be held next week and as tempted as
                I am to nominate myself, I am not looking for another obligation to dedicate my time to. I can still
                make a difference by producing quality articles as and when I want.

                The shunt last night affected me more than I initially thought. I woke up this morning unable to turn my
                head, and I have to keep everything straight to ease the pain. A couple of friends from the racing
                society came over to check on me (since, after the track doctor gave me the all-clear last night, why
                not get a second opinion from more ersatz medical professionals too?). They think it's probably a bad
                sprain, but if I still can't turn my head by this time tomorrow, I'll see an actual doctor instead of
                relying on these self-proclaimed ones. The only way I can turn is by moving my entire body which makes
                me look like a life-sized marionette. On a more optimistic note, I have devoted the day to coding, which
                has put me a few lectures ahead so every cloud has a silver lining I guess.

                Let’s Go Karting! The highly anticipated taster session took place this evening, with slots allocated on
                a first-come-first-served basis to the first thirty individuals who checked the Karting group chat this
                morning. That’s right—last-minute planning and a limited number of spaces. Pilates would have to be

                The main draw? Everything was complimentary thanks to DMU Sport. I’d been eager to return to the track
                ever since rekindling my interest in F1 back in 2022, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I
                donned my brand-new Adidas trainers, intent on breaking them in, but almost immediately upon stepping
                off the bus at the circuit, a kart whizzed by, splattering mud all over them. “Gives them character,”
                was the circuit manager’s attempt at sarcasm. I wanted to wind him...
                <br><br>
                Of the thirty participants, ten belonged to the Karting society, and twelve had recently been karting
                within the past year. I found myself among the minority of novices who had never been Karting before.
                The event began with three practice sessions, each accommodating ten drivers and allowing us fifteen
                minutes to familiarise ourselves with the track and record our best time. That time would dictate our
                starting positions in the subsequent heats.
                <br><br>
                I was testing out my tires, checking my grip level, sticking to the racing line, before actually
                attempting a flying lap. Meanwhile, there were drivers going off at every corner. Powersliding round the
                bends, rearranging the cones to the pit wall. It was pandemonium. The marshals lining the track offered
                little more than feeble warnings, holding up signs that read Calm Down and Be Careful. What is this, a
                token gesture to deflect liability in case we end up decapitating ourselves?
                <br><br>
                It wasn’t long after till I had my first shunt. A Verstappen wannabe dive bombed up the inside, looking
                for a gap that clearly wasn’t there. He left the braking too late and drove straight into me.
                Thankfully, these kart can only reach 40mph otherwise I might have been in trouble. After a stern look
                from the marshall and a yellow flag, we carried on with the qualifying session.
                <br><br>
                Despite not having driven a kart in over a decade, I managed to secure third place in my qualifying
                session with a respectable 47.3 seconds. For context, the society chair—a seasoned amateur—was clocking
                in at 41.5 seconds.
                <br><br>
                The race itself was as adrenaline-fueled as I had hoped. My qualifying time placed me third in the
                second heat—essentially the second group of ten. It was a rolling start, so we missed out on the
                exhilaration of lining up on the grid and watching the lights go out. Nevertheless, after a swift exit
                from the pits, I began closing in on the kart ahead. Biding my time for the first few laps, I inched
                closer and closer. Approaching the last corner, I decided to make a move up the inside. Unfortunately,
                my assigned kart lacked the same grip as the one I used during qualifying. I spun out, ending up facing
                the wrong direction on the track. The gap between me and the racers behind wasn’t as comfortable as I’d
                assumed—two karts barreled into me, sending me careening off the track entirely. Red flags waved, and we
                were all sent back to the pits.
                <br><br>
                Though I felt fine, I had to undergo a medical assessment for potential whiplash since this crash was
                much more egregious than my first altercation in the practice. After a brief convalescence and a
                thumbs-up from the ersatz doctor on site, I was cleared to return to the track. Yet, as I sit here
                writing this, my neck throbs with the lingering aftermath.
                <br><br>
                Despite my injury, I did manage to make that move on the pole sitter, claiming victory in my heat. I am
                much too honourable to brag, but I must admit I felt a surge of gratification. Unfortunately, this will
                be a one-off appearance for me, as the society membership costs £40, and I’m tighter than a drum when it
                comes to spending. Cough cough. The socials will still be available as I’ve been looking forward to
                having simpatico people to share F1 views with. Unfortunately, it looks like a great number of these
                people are Verstappen and Red Bull fans. Looks like the socials won’t be as congenial as I first
                thought.

            <h2>Sunday, 13th October</h2>
            <p>
                The day after departing London is always a depressing one. From getting a taste of where I could be to
                the realisation of where I am. Only eight more months in Leicester before I’m hopefully off to do better
                things.
                <br><br>
                I have been in St Martins House for three weeks now, and it seems like the ‘honeymoon period’ has worn
                off. The cleanliness of the kitchen has somewhat deteriorated since I’ve been away. The stove is covered
                in dried food, crumbs have been left covering the worktops, the floor is sticky with God knows what, and
                the sink is about to be clogged with the amount of food left in the drain. I’m about ready to start
                knocking on doors and cracking the whip, but in an effort to maintain the equilibrium of the flat, I
                tidied it up myself. <em>Just this once.</em> Of course, I’m not a fool—I’ve left a sarcastic note on
                the
                worktops detailing my hard labour. They can interpret it however they like.
                <br><br>
                Sorting the hundreds of photos from the past few days is a time-consuming job, as many are similar but
                focus on different vantage points. It’s difficult to see which are considered good and which are
                mediocre from a non-biased position since I’m the photographer. My artistic chauvinism insists that they
                are all masterpieces, so I’m getting Natalia and Emily to have a look at them when I see them next. God,
                is that the type of person I am? <em>“Everyone gather round whilst I show you slides of my
                holidays.”</em>How
                hubristic is that! Regardless, it’ll be good to get their opinions.

            <h2>Saturday, 12th October</h2>
            <p>
                Ironically, my best night’s sleep since moving back to University has been in Liam’s bed. I think that
                is the message I’ve been waiting for to invest in further padding for my springboard for a mattress I’ve
                got currently.
                <br><br>
                My plan was to head swiftly to the British Museum this morning since I like to update myself on the
                exhibitions at least once a year. Since my Erasmus year in Stockholm, it’s been almost two since I last
                visited. After a late one last night, time was against me. My train was departing at half two so instead
                of rushing round the museum, I opted for a photoshoot of Marble Arch instead. Again putting my
                photography skills to the test until it was time to go.
                <br><br>
                It’s been another successful outing to London: two shows, a Globe Theatre tour, an F1 exhibition, a
                plethora of photos and a long-overdue catchup with Matthew. Until we meet again, London, may the
                distance be brief and my return quick upon the wind.

            <h2>Friday, 11th October</h2>
            <p>
                After a free trip on the DLR—thanks to my confusion about where to scan my card—I arrived at the ExCeL
                Centre in East London for the Formula One exhibition. Usually, when visiting London, I stay within a
                central area—roughly bounded by St Pancras, Mile End, the Globe Theatre, and Hyde Park. This time,
                though, I ventured further, and East London didn’t disappoint. The area is beautiful, with stunning
                views, especially from the Royal Victoria Dock footbridge, which offers a spectacular vantage point of
                the Canary Wharf skyline.
                <br><br>
                The F1 exhibition was well-curated, guiding visitors through a maze of attractions with provided
                headphones. It delved into the sport's rich history, highlighting Bernie Ecclestone's pivotal role in
                making it an international phenomenon, as well as celebrating the successes of legendary drivers like
                Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher, and Lewis Hamilton. The exhibition also
                covered important safety advancements, including the introduction of crash barriers and the halo. Among
                the F1 cars on display were the RB16—not Verstappen’s record-breaking RB19 from last season—and the 2020
                Mercedes. One particularly striking exhibit was the charred remains of Romain Grosjean’s car from his
                harrowing 2020 crash; it's a sobering sight, but a powerful reminder of how fortunate he was to survive.
                <br><br>
                Around the venue, screens featured interviews with key figures discussing car design, engineering, and
                famous rivalries between drivers and teams. For £30, the experience felt like good value, offering
                plenty of insight into the world of Formula One.
                <br><br>
                Of course, the exhibition ended with a gift shop. I hoped to find a Mercedes Team hoodie—its colours
                more subtle than the bold orange McLaren one I had returned yesterday—but the prices were eye-watering.
                £15 for a keyring, £45 for caps, and a staggering £130 for hoodies. I wasn’t the only one taken aback;
                murmurs of incredulity echoed among the other visitors.
                <br><br>
                Resisting any impulse purchases, I left quickly and made my way to the Globe Theatre for a guided tour.
                London's transport system is truly one of its best features—being able to travel ten miles from East
                London to London Bridge for a reasonable fare is a major advantage. It’s just a shame that the railways
                don’t share this kind of accessible pricing.
                <br><br>
                Arriving a little earlier than expected, I was able to take a peek inside Tate Modern. I wish I could
                say that this was a refreshing change from my go-to art venue of the National Gallery, but the
                abstractionism on display bordered on frivolous and arid. Tate Modern focuses on modern art from the
                past century. This makes it ambiguous to define given it’s hard to discern what this epoch will be
                remembered for in a few hundred years time. The Neoclassicism of the 1700s is as unique and separate
                from the Romanticism and Realism of the 1800s. I only hope that the large canvas of painted stripes does
                not go down as century defining work.
                <br><br>
                It got me thinking what is the purpose of Art. Should it be conformist, contentious, byzantine? The
                exhibition I saw was about celebrating the monotony of everyday life. That’s why it included many photos
                of household items, populated streets, and shop windows. This would be a captivating collection had it
                been in any other location but London.
                <br><br>
                It raises the question: does art exist to highlight what we overlook, or is it meant to transcend the
                ordinary? An exhibition like this could be fascinating in a more remote, serene setting, where the
                everyday life on display might contrast sharply with the viewer’s experience of the surroundings. But in
                London, it risks becoming part of the noise, a reflection of what’s already outside the gallery walls.
                <br><br>
                In that sense, art’s purpose becomes layered: it can be conformist, capturing and celebrating life as it
                is, contentious, challenging our assumptions and provoking thought, or byzantine, complex and difficult
                to unravel. But perhaps, like this exhibition, it can also be a mirror, inviting us to see the
                overlooked beauty or dullness in our own routines—turning the ordinary into something worth
                contemplating.
                <br><br>
                Damn it. I wasn’t that impressed with the art but the fact that it has garnered this level of analysis,
                answers my question of the purpose of the art on display.
                <br><br>
                Onto more impressive sights. The Globe Theatre tour was as magical as expected. The afternoon matinee
                performance of The Comedy of Errors had just concluded which meant the team were dismantling the set to
                prepare for the evening show of Hansel & Gretel. The guide was an all access pass to the Globe, teaching
                us about the history and the architecture which makes the plays come to life. This is the third Globe
                Theatre; only opening in 1997. The project was spearheaded by Sam Wanamaker who was an actor and
                director, but mainly a Shakespeare aficionado. Wanamaker accumulated the funds from wealthy supporters
                and benefactors and immortalised their largesse by engraving their names in the concrete slabs outside
                the Theatre. Some notable names include Lawrence Olivier, Alfred Hitchcock, Maggie Smith, Dame Judi
                Dench, and Kenneth Branagh. Wanamaker was quite ingenuitive. He went down the phone book and called
                everyone with the surname of Shakespeare asking for donations. Unsurprisingly, most supported the cause
                as it meant they could be a part of history.
                <br><br>
                Taking a break from my cultural activities, it was time for pool and a catchup with Matthew. The
                mechanics which I learnt from snooker served me well. This is how I expected the Pool Tournament to go
                during freshers but was instead greeted with bent cues and unsportsmanlike behaviour from my opponent.
                After a bite to eat, Matthew gave me a tour around the Barbican and then we hit the pubs. I say this
                everytime I visit London but the people who live there don’t realise how lucky they are to have
                everything right on their doorstep. Culture, musicals, plays, tourist attractions, architecture,
                palaces, parks, skyscrapers, castles, and Shakespeare. It’s probably best that I don’t live there yet,
                otherwise I would bankrupt myself by seeing every play under the sun.

            <h2>Thursday, 10th October</h2>
            <p>
                After my indulgent spending spree on Tuesday night (yes, that blog was an allegory about my reckless
                shopping), today brought the stark realisation that my dilemma lies in want, not need. While some
                purchases were necessities, the more extravagant ones—the McLaren F1 hoodie, the Levi's jeans—were
                better returned. My frugal instincts, once again, saved me from myself. Yet, there’s nothing more
                déclassé than walking back into the stores where, just days earlier, I had proudly parted with a large
                chunk of my net worth, only to ask for refunds. I could feel the judgement in the cashier's eyes.
                <br><br>
                One particularly irksome trend emerged: the disappearance of the physical card swipe in the refund
                process. At each store, they processed the refund remotely, without me even tapping my card.
                Unacceptable! I want visual confirmation! Either the reassuring beep or preferably dollar signs floating
                through the air! The clear sign that my money is being returned. Instead, I’m met with the assurances of
                the cashier who has no obligation to spare me from their mendacity. “Your refund will be back in your
                account in three to five days.” Will it? I suppose I have no choice but to trust you then.
                <br><br>
                Putting this behind me, it was time for a change of scenery. Goodbye Leicester. Hello the bright lights
                of London. First on the agenda: SIX! The Musical. Immediately, time was against me as I rushed to the
                Vaudeville Theatre as the train was inevitably delayed. The musical was about the six ex-wives of Henry
                VIII and offered a refreshing format when compared to other musicals. Instead of telling a story,
                reliving their lives, it was similar to a concert with each character trying to persuade the audience
                that they were the most memorable wife. Complete with audience interaction and individual solos, I would
                recommend it to everyone. I thought the short runtime would hinder it but instead it enriches
                everything, giving it a brisk pace that keeps everyone engaged and entertained from start to finish.
                Each performance is a burst of energy, drawing you in with catchy tunes and clever lyrics. Similar to
                Hamilton, its purpose is to teach children about history whilst incorporating modern references; joking
                about the patriarchy and commenting on the male hegemony of today. It is critically well received for
                these reasons as well as passing the Bechdel test which most musicals tend to fail.*
                <br><br>
                After a brief photography session with my new zoom lens, capturing the London skyline between the
                Vaudeville Theatre and the Globe Theatre, I transitioned from reliving the embellished history of Henry
                VIII in the early sixteenth century to exploring the world of Shakespeare in the late sixteenth century.
                Liam was just as ebullient to be spending a night watching Shakespeare, which he showed by heading
                straight to the bar to indulge in red wine before we took our seats. The Comedy of Errors, a classic
                tale of mistaken identity, intrigue, and the complexities of love… the paragon of Shakespearean
                Literature. It’s about two sets of identical twins who are separated at birth and accidentally reunited
                through a series of fortunate circumstances. The ensuing chaos leads to comedic situations, wrongful
                accusations, and of course, a joyful reunion. This certainly wasn’t a tragedy.
                <br><br>
                The Globe wasn’t sold out but still boasted a good turnout for a cold October evening. When I go again
                in the future, I will be sure to put extra layers on. Tonight, Liam graciously supplied me with a woolly
                jumper as I was expecting the same warm temperatures I was enjoying in Leicester but ended up freezing
                instead. Two hours of laughs, shenanigans and tomfoolery, the players took their final bow and it was
                time to go. Time to have a rough night’s sleep on Liam’s floor.
                <br><br>
                *The Bechdel Test is a simple measure of female representation in fiction, requiring that a work

            <h2>Wednesday, 9th October</h2>
            <p>
                Soar Point was buzzing as ever. The raucous thrills of students from all faculties, enjoying the
                camaraderie of their respective societies. The Women's Champions League games, which garnered a larger
                crowd than I would have expected in a student bar, were displayed on every screen. Each table was lined
                with benches and discounted menus to accommodate the extra influx of customers. Personally, I don’t know
                much about Women’s football. The runners who I was with, shared a passing interest but their enthusiasm
                wavered once the conversation moved off Lionesses Euro Campaign. While it was a successful night for
                Manchester City who won against Barcelona, Arsenal didn’t share the same glory, being huminited 5-2.
                When the fourth goal went in, that’s when the uproar started. A group of supporters couldn’t contain
                their disappointment and as one would expect from a footballing crowd, unleashed a diatribe of abuse at
                the screens. It was no different from what can be heard at a men’s game but because it was Women’s
                football and the pub was filled with students, many disapproved of the misogynistic epithets. Still, I
                didn’t think it was anything egregious so continued my conversation with the runners. Five minutes
                later, the fans were being escorted out of the pub; followed by the owner’s statement, apologising for
                an offence which people might have suffered. I was in disbelief. I guess that’s the level we’re at here.
                I best not bring out my best Bernard Manning impressions or Jimmy Carr jokes. Soft tarts.

            <p>
                Let me tell you a story. It’s about a man; tall, debonair, a true gentleman with a penchant for fine
                things. He carried himself with the grace of nobility, believing firmly that a man’s mood and fortune
                were shaped, in no small part, by how he presented himself to the world. His garments, he believed, were
                a reflection of his spirit, and so he took great care to adorn himself in the finest cloth that gold
                could buy.
                <br><br>
                This man, though refined and prudent in most affairs, was not immune to the whims of vanity, and the
                allure of luxury tugged often at his heart. One evening, word reached him of a rare event—a grand
                market, closed to the commoners, where only those of youthful vigour and standing might enter. It was
                whispered that the best merchants of the realm would offer their goods at prices so low, they defied
                reason. A nobleman's wardrobe for a tradesman’s coin.
                <br><br>
                To make the market more tempting for these young souls, the guilds set forth amusements to capture their
                fancies. There was music, lively as a royal ball, played by minstrels who stood high on a dais in the
                midst of the square. Brightly coloured pennants flapped in the evening air, strewn across the market
                stalls like the banners of a noble tournament. It was like a merry festival, yet strange, for no guiding
                hand of elder or master was there to rein in the wild spirit of youth. For but two hours, these
                apprentices had free reign to barter, trade, and snatch up the finest wares at unheard-of discounts, as
                if time itself had been turned to favour them.
                <br><br>
                Into this revelry strode our protagonist; a man no different from his peers, eyes wide at the splendour
                and goods displayed before him. He had no thought of thrift or restraint, for such a night comes but
                seldom, and never again might such bargains be offered. So, as though possessed by a strange frenzy, he
                dashed from one stall to the next, his purse jingling with the coin he had saved.
                <br><br>
                He purchased fine woollen breeches, velvet doublets fit for a nobleman, a grand leather jerkin, and even
                a hooded cloak emblazoned with the crest of a famous knightly order. Each piece he bought with little
                thought, for the prices, they said, were far lower than any would find on a common market day. And so,
                laden with goods, he strode back to his quarters, a triumphant smile upon his face.
                <br><br>
                Yet, as the moon rose higher in the sky, and the frenzy of the fair faded, the young man sat amidst his
                newly acquired riches and began to reckon his coin. He gazed in his reflection; in awe at his sartorial
                elegance for it was then that a troubling thought took root. He had spent far more than he had ever
                intended. What use had he for so many fine garments? Could he truly afford to keep all that he had
                purchased? And indeed, did he even need such luxuries, when simpler wares might serve him just as well?
                <br><br>
                And thus, my friends, this tale stands as a caution to all. For even the sharpest mind can be dulled by
                the glitter of a fleeting bargain, and in the rush to seize every treasure, one may return home burdened
                with far more than they need—or can pay for. Better to be the one who walks the fair with a discerning
                eye and a steady hand, rather than the one who staggers away with empty pockets and full regrets. After
                all, it’s not the abundance of fine things that brings satisfaction, but the wisdom to leave behind what
                you never truly needed.
                <br><br>
                Hopefully, you can deduce the allegory behind that story. I’m sure the more perceptive folk will pick up
                on the deeper meaning. Or perhaps, much like the man in the story, you’ve been swept up in my fine words
                and now find yourself sitting there wondering, "Wait… what was the point again?" But fear not—unlike the
                man, at least you didn’t spend anything and it was only time you wasted!

            <p>
                Waking up at five in the morning does not do anything to improve my productivity for the day. If
                anything, it stymies motivation. I struggle to sleep because of a number of factors. One: my mind is too
                active with developing mobile apps. I’m thinking of all the opportunities which become available once I
                complete this module. Two: my duvet is two thick for these warm autumn evenings. Opening my window is
                not an option to counteract this because the incessant sirens are insufferable. Three: my mattress is
                springy - and not in a good way. Four: There are too many things happening at the moment for me to get
                an early night anyway.
                <br><br>
                So what do I do if I can’t comfortably get back to sleep? Well, I start reading, which is futile because
                I haven’t had enough REM sleep which means the part of the brain which consolidates memory is not
                working efficiently. Thus when I awake a few hours later, I will have forgotten the pages I’ve covered.
                Option two is to persist in trying to sleep which is rarely successful. Lastly, I will start coding.
                This normally means I’ve given up on sleep and am ready to start the day… at five in the morning. Call
                it productive or an auspicious start to the day. It takes its toll on me when it comes to the evening
                activities when I am struggling to keep my eyes open. I have sacrificed running with the group tonight
                and cancelled my place in Pilates. All because I am sleep deprived. I need to do something to fix this.

            <p>
                Bollocks. I’ve made the Futsal team. After my poor performance during the trials on Friday night, I
                thought it would be a long shot to assume that I’ll be selected. Obviously, the coach had a few
                laudatory voices chirping in his ear convincing him that I’m worth the gamble. As previously mentioned,
                I have a busy schedule with all the other activities and societies I want to be involved in. Ideally,
                futsal would just be a social event where I could pick and choose the sessions which I wanted to attend.
                This news certainly has complicated a few things. There is no rush to decide as I don’t need to pay the
                sign-up fee for a few weeks, therefore my plan is to stick to my timetable prioritising Hackers and
                Demon Media and see how many free evenings I can spare after those commitments. Futsal doesn’t embellish
                my CV which is why it’s third in my pecking order. Irrespective of my dilemma, I am honoured to be
                selected; knowing that my skill is being recognised.

                What brings together, transgender people, ex-drug addicts, insomniacs, non-binaries, and schizophrenia
                patients. That’s right. The Media society. The home to the society outcasts basking in solitude.
                Everyone as uniquely protuberant as the next. These people have taken the time out of their day, exited
                their caves, to grace us with their presence to join the new intake of Demon Media. “Write what you
                know,” was the advice the current editor-in-chief told us. Hardly a niche magazine then but if the
                possibilities are endless with little moderation or censorship, this magazine is going to be a mix
                between Orwell’s ‘nineteen eighty-four’ and Freud’s ‘The Psychopathology of Everyday Life’. Out of the
                three strands of Media, I am focusing on Radio and the Magazine. Enough to learn new skills but not
                dominate all of my time.
                <br><br>
                For the record, that’s Futsal, Running, Karting, Hackers, Demon Media, Racing and Pilates all happening
                alongside my studies. There are also cultural exchange classes which look appealing which run from
                November to March which serve as a good additional qualification to complete after my Erasmus year. With
                all of these extra curriculars, it will be impossible to keep up to date with everything so some will
                have to be demoted to occasional outings. Competitive futsal is looking less and less likely since I
                have access to free sessions when I have time anyway at the Watershed. The trial this evening went
                poorly too so I’ll see if I even make the team. At the end, I was still asked what my number was so
                there may be hope yet. I think I’m being picked from reputation alone. After gaining the nickname ‘Cold
                Palmer’ by the players already on the team, it’s evident I showed some skill in previous sessions to
                gain such a reputable moniker.
                <br><br>
                Irrespective of the outcome this evening, Monday evenings are also reserved for Pilates. It’s four days
                on and I can still feel my abs flaring up when I sit up in the morning. Karting will likely take a back
                seat too; partly because it’s expensive to participate and very time consuming. I can still take part in
                the society socials at Soar point to watch the F1 races on the weekend which I’m fervently waiting for.
                <br><br>
                PS. The camera lens which I bought off ebay on Wednesday evening arrived five days earlier than
                expected. First inspections have revealed no conspicuous faults but we’ll see when I go for my first
                photography session this weekend. Everything seems to be falling into place auspiciously.

            <h2>Thursday, 3rd October</h2>
            <p>
                Bit of a disconcerting atmosphere in the building today. Similar to a heavy pall lingering over a city.
                It started off as a normal day; all was well. That was until a resident overdosed in the common room. I
                don’t know the symptoms of an overdose or what one looks like outside of the flicks, but from the
                detailed descriptions I got from my friends on the ground floor, it sounds similar to a seizure. I’m not
                sure who was with her at the time or what was taken, but by this evening, the Rashomon effect had truly
                taken hold, and I was hearing all forms of speculation. Was she suicidal? Was it a cry for help? Was she
                spiked? Was it an accident? From the tales I’ve heard today, it’s similar to a creative writing
                assignment I did in Stockholm where we were given the end of a short story and we needed to write the
                beginning. Each story is different, with complex characters and embellished storylines. The only
                definitive fact I know is that someone overdosed. Current status unknown. End of.
                <br><br>
                Onto a lighter topic. On my perpetual quest for social interaction this year, I had another society
                gathering this evening: DMU Hackers. The one I’ve been most anticipating. Relevant to Comp. Science by
                association, though not directly included in my course modules. Dilan was genuinely pleased to see me
                when I stepped out of the elevator. I think a friendly face was all he needed since he was running the
                society this year. Given his extensive knowledge in Cyber Security, he is more than qualified. In
                addition to the culmination of his placement year at IBM, he could pass for a lecturer now. I won’t bore
                you with the ins and outs of the meeting, but it was great fun, and I regret not participating in
                previous years. If only I were more confident…
                <br><br>
                We concluded the meeting with a visit to Soar Point, the campus sports bar, which I am starting to
                become a frequent visitor through the different societies. Mehmet, Natalia’s boyfriend, was there with a
                few of his engineering friends who he introduced me to. Some I already had the pleasure of speaking with
                at the DMU Racing brief. These are the lads who will hopefully be teaching me how to build an engine. I
                just need to manage my time effectively so I have enough bandwidth to take part in all these
                extracurriculars. My current thought process is omitting Futsal from my schedule and only doing a
                session a week instead of the competitive league for which I have been scouted. The trial is tomorrow
                evening, so I’ll update you on how that plans out. Though the first Demon Media society meeting starts
                at six, so I’ll have to think of a crafty excuse to account for my premature exit. See what I mean about
                my busy schedule…

            <h2>Wednesday, 2nd October</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a thief. Well, actually, a fraudster would be a more accurate description. Remember those Asics
                running trainers which were half a size too big? Well, after a five-minute cleanup job and a steady hand
                attaching the tags again, I have managed to fool the Sports Direct staff into thinking they were unworn.
                That’s right—a pair of running trainers which I ran 5k in while it rained, plus an active Pilates
                session straight afterward, and I’ve exchanged them for a pair which is half a size smaller. I almost
                feel guilty, but my acuity towards subterfuge is to be admired.
                <br><br>
                Onto my academic endeavors for the day. After the unchallenging lecture and practical session yesterday,
                and consultation with Dillan, I have persuaded my course leader to allow me to switch to Mobile App
                Development. Therefore, I am not repeating the same module which I completed in second year. Also, this
                means I get to have classes with Dilan, which is always a huge benefit. Why not just stick to Big Data
                and Machine Learning since you’ve already got the finished coursework, I hear you ask? Well, even though
                I achieved a first in the module last time out, I actually want to learn a new programming language and
                get a modicum of experience in the mobile development industry. To be honest, I despised operating the
                infrastructure which DMU employed to handle Big Data databases, so I didn’t want to put myself through
                that again. Also, the Kotlin programming language is so intuitive; I practically already know it from
                learning its derivatives.
                <br><br>
                After a long-anticipated wait, Jimmy Carr has finally come to Leicester. We managed to snag tickets for
                the half-nine showing—me, Natalia, and Natalia’s boyfriend, Mehmet, who happens to be a really nice guy.
                The show was as expected, with insults, heckles, and banter. Very funny. The audience participation is a
                must because I felt like snappy one-liners get tiresome after a while. The spontaneity of the audience
                is what makes it unique. Though there were a lot of jokes which I have seen him perform before on
                YouTube, etc. When the audience shouts a heckle relating to his tax affairs, he has the same
                choreographed routine to defend himself. Also, rehearsed clapbacks when asked about Trump, Biden,
                Starmer, Epstein... I heard him do one joke which I first heard him perform on an episode of <em>Eight
                Out
                of Ten Cats</em> in 2019. Nevertheless, it was a great evening, and I would recommend everyone go to
                watch
                him at least once.

            <h2>Tuesday, 1st October</h2>
            <p>
                The society group chats have been in full swing today. The Racing Society has been talking about F1 for
                six hours now—and I love it. There are around seventy members, each with a fervent opinion about the
                status quo in the driver championship. I occasionally throw in an obviously contentious point of view
                just to rattle a few people. I know—I’m a prick. I am also part of the Running group chat, which is home
                dominantly to last night’s joggers complaining about their aches and pains. I’m in the same boat as
                them, but I’m stoic and don’t publicly announce my weaknesses.
                <br><br>
                A dark horse society which I’ve joined is the Doctor Who Society. There are only a handful of us in the
                group chat, so I don’t know what level of participation I am going to achieve. Call me old-fashioned,
                but 40% of the members identify as ‘they,’ and they have already given me negative first
                impressions—either from their kowtowing to other group members to hammer home their pronouns or their
                Calvinistic approach to running a society. A personal pet peeve of mine, and I know it’s nitpicky:
                people who don’t use proper grammar or spelling when texting. I don’t mind abbreviations, but
                individuals who say ‘I fought’ instead of ‘I thought’ are clearly Satanists. That is a speech
                impediment; therefore, they have no excuse to extend that poor vocabulary into the medium of text.
                <br><br>
                Moving away from societies, I had my first timetabled lecture and practical today. Having made my notes
                yesterday, this introductory session was nothing strenuous. The first Big Data and Machine Learning
                lecture was no hardship. The most discerning thing I learned is that out of a class of approximately one
                hundred students, 71% had never used the Python programming language. These are Computer Science
                students! As I have already done two Big Data modules (one at DMU in second year and one in Stockholm),
                I should be an expert at machine learning algorithms. I must not get complacent; I must not get
                complacent; I must not get complacent.
                <br><br>
                The biggest hardship I faced this morning, technologically speaking, is trying to get my Linux laptop
                connected to the DMU WiFi. After thirty minutes debugging myself and a further thirty-five minutes with
                a crestfallen IT officer in the library, I finally connected. I am the first student he has helped who
                has faced this problem in thirteen years. Speaking on the phone to the IT staff in Gateway House, he was
                elucidating the need for updated documentation so these problems don’t reoccur. Also, in that
                conversation, I was referred to as ‘a gentleman of discernment and taste’ when it comes to operating
                systems.
                <br><br>
                Now I’m off to the DSU to participate in the pièce de résistance of my fresher's journey—the event which
                I have been preparing for since March: the pool tournament.

                The DMU Global trips have been released. During my time here at university, I have made the most of
                these trips—first going to Bilbao and then spending a year in Stockholm. This year is my final year, so
                I obviously don’t want anything to clash; however, it looks like the majority of trips are happening
                during the first week of Easter, which is convenient. There are a few that have caught my eye: Berlin,
                Salzburg, Dublin. Unfortunately, they are not available to my faculty. There are several trips in the
                extracurricular category which are applicable to me: employment workshops in Paris and culture in
                Alicante. I would be happy with attending either. I have been to Spain a lot in the past few years, but
                I cannot turn down the opportunity to practice my Spanish. Alternatively, I have been looking at going
                to Paris for a while, and this would give me ample opportunity to see all the sights. All trips are five
                days long, but the bursary applied to each varies. The opportunities I am eying up will cost me around
                £200, which is very good since accommodation and flights are included.
                <br><br>
                Since the academic year started today, the remaining freshers' activities are taking place almost every
                evening this week. I am not a drinker nor a clubber, so I don’t have much planned this week. The pool
                tournament I have been practicing for is taking place tomorrow night, marking the end of my freshers.
                Most of the societies have their first meetings or activities this week, so my evenings are almost all
                booked up anyway.
                <br><br>
                This evening, for instance, I was running with the group. We were doing laps around a track. Lauren is
                the pace setter, as she can run a mile in around 6.30 minutes. In total, we covered an accumulated 5k,
                which is a nice round number. Upon finally running in my new trainers, I have come to the conclusion
                that they are actually half a size too big for me. If I am duplicitous enough, I will clean them up and
                try to return them. Though that might be too devious even for a man with my flexible moral compass.
                <br><br>
                After running, I had Pilates booked at the Watershed. I hadn’t eaten anything in five hours, my muscles
                ached, my groin was tight, and my thigh was on the verge of being pulled. I was satisfied with the
                exercise I had done for the day and was ready to shower and crawl into bed, but Kyra, one of the
                runners, persuaded me to attend since she didn’t want to go alone. Having completed a couple of yoga
                sessions, I was expecting much of the same. In truth, there were a lot of similar moves; however,
                Pilates focused more on core exercises. Instead of completing them until you hit your rep target, the
                purpose is to control each movement and take your time, many of which activated my abs more than any
                workout session in the past. Despite my trepidation, it felt like it soothed my aches and pains; though
                now, I have the added addition of stinging abs along with painful legs when I wake tomorrow.

            <h2>Sunday, 29th September</h2>
            <p>
                Treachery! I have just found out that ‘Fear Her’ has been removed from BBC iPlayer because that episode
                contains scenes with the disgraced Hugh Edwards. Doctor Who is well-known for including real newsreaders
                or presenters to increase the verisimilitude and Britishness of the show. While this contributes to its
                charm, it also means the show is subject to the ever-shifting landscape of BBC politics, which the
                corporation must carefully navigate. Since Edwards' declasse status, the Beeb has rightly cut ties with
                him, but that means that any programs he has appeared in need to be removed from the public domain.
                Alas, even episodes where he only features for a meagre few seconds. You would think the higher-ups at
                the Beeb would tactfully dub the scenes or even recut the episodes given the popularity of the show, but
                no. Hitherto, season two of Doctor Who is missing a much-loved episode…
                <br><br>
                Moving onto a less contentious part of my day, after last night’s festivities, I am walking around
                zombie-like today. Anything less than the required eight hours of sleep gives me headaches.
                Nevertheless, I trekked to Abbey Park to partake in the final fresher event and to round off a very
                successful week of acclimatizing to life back in Leicester. ‘Park Life’, as it is advertised, was
                supposed to be a carnival-type affair with games, activities, crafts, and sports—mediums to help the new
                intake mix and socialise. Arriving at midday, an hour into these events, I was greeted with a rather
                lacklustre show of DSU ambassadors and a scarcely filled park. Only a small group of students decided to
                show up, meaning the overall success of the event was wavering. It’s one of those things which takes
                mass participation for the event to be successful. Despite the event being ‘sold out’ on the DSU
                website, the actual turnout was met with general apathy, so I made a premature exit and had my first
                relaxing day to myself, where I could watch the football and catch up on my reading.
                <br><br>
                In other news, Natalia has booked the tickets to see Jimmy Carr after consulting Mehmet. I have been
                watching this venue for a while, so it’s good to finally have it booked. Alas, now I just need to try
                and fit it into my busy schedule.

            <h2>Saturday, 28th September</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first day which I have no DMU activities or sports on. Thankfully, instead of rattling
                around my room for the day, I do have a few errands to run. After doing the weekly shop at the big
                Tesco, I also picked up a few extra things for Octavia’s party tonight. It’s the first time meeting up
                with Emily and Natalia since before leaving for Stockholm so I am euphorically looking forward to it. Of
                course, Saturday’s are reserved for football and with Nana’s VirginGo installed on my iPad, this makes
                it significantly easier rather than finding a dodgy stream that doesn’t buffer. Pleased with
                Middlesbrough’s two nil win over Stoke, I watched another film which had been on my watch list since its
                release: Miller’s Girl.
                <br><br>
                It was a low-budget flick, written by a writer with credits in the MCU and DC world but this was her
                first stand-alone film which she also directed. Ignoring the low ratings on IMDB, I thought it was
                enjoyable. Nothing too spectacular, but as a writer, I appreciate the quality vocabulary used in the
                film. Facilely, the story follows the life of a student (Jenna Ortega) who takes inspiration from her
                English Professor's book and uses it in her college thesis. The issue is that the Professor’s book
                contains an erotic scene and the student focuses entirely on that scene - writing fictitiously what
                could happen between the student and the professor. I actually enjoyed it though it may be because it is
                based around writing and the narrative using a varied lexicon instead of the mundane vernacular which
                appeals to the mass market. Martin Freeman and Jenna Ortega are personal favourites of mine too.
                <br><br>
                Moving onto the festivities this evening. I wasn’t told that it was Octavia’s birthday on Monday till
                very late into the evening. Honestly, when they were bringing out the cake, it should have been a
                giveaway but still I was ignorant of the fact. Natalia has continued working for the lecturer as a
                research assistant which she was with for the majority of her final year. She did think about doing a
                PhD but ultimately opted against it. Technically, she is taking a gap year to get more experience doing
                research as that is what she hopes to be doing in the future. As it is a paltry wage; she is still
                working at Starbucks on the weekend but as a manager now. Emily and Octavia work in the same care
                facility, helping children with learning difficulties through the medium of drama. Very noble indeed but
                it does suit their empathetic need to help people.
                <br><br>
                Natalia’s boyfriend was there: Mehmet, who coincidentally, I had already met at the futsal session
                yesterday. Small world huh. He is doing engineering and is part of the Racing Society which I’ve signed
                up to. I guess I’ll be seeing a lot of him. Good thing, he’s such a laid back type of person. Emily and
                Taves’ brothers also turned up; Mikey and Tobey who are good fun to be around. Mikey is 23 and works in
                a zoo. Toby is slightly more reserved but he is only 18 and starting UOL next week. I was the oldest in
                the room; a fact which I didn’t think bothered me but as I’ve had pointed out to me this week, this is
                starting to be a common occurrence. We played a lot of board games and a few party type games like
                charades. All good fun of course. Living in the building attached to Highcross is very convenient
                because it is a short walk through the shopping mall to get to their flat, however at two o’clock in the
                morning, I needed to add another fifteen minutes onto the journey, walking the circumference of the
                buildings.
                <br><br>
                Exhausted, I was in bed and asleep by three o’clock. My springy bed isn’t as big an issue as I initially
                thought. Accordingly, when you’re tired enough, you’ll sleep anywhere. After the busy week I’ve had,
                it’s not surprising that I haven’t had time to complain!

            <h2>Friday, 27th September</h2>
            <p>
                After a busy four days meeting and greeting new people, today can be classed as a quasi day off. There
                is a ‘fun day’ at the DSU but based on the description of the event online, it sounds uninteresting and
                just a ploy in order to put another event on the schedule in order to make the purchase of the freshers
                wristbands seem good value. For the sole purpose of getting me out of the flat, I played football
                instead. As it was mid-afternoon, it was a much quieter session but the skill level was distinctly
                higher. This could be considered a training session for the DMU Futsal team because there were so many
                already distinguished players in the game. Nevertheless, I held my own. Scored a couple, assisted a few
                more. Try-outs will be interesting.
                <br><br>
                Came home to find my room had been broken into. Just kidding. The plumber had let himself in to fix the
                leaky toilet. The push button had too much pressure on it so he replaced the full body. He shares
                similar views to me about Leicester. As he’s an Aussie, he only travels into Leicester for work but
                couldn’t live here. If it wasn’t for his wife, he would be moving back to Australia. He’s the first
                person I’ve met too who speaks complimentary about the British weather. After he was done, I had the
                rest of the day to myself. ‘Miss Sloane’ has been on my watchlist forever so I finally had the time to
                sit down and enjoy it. No football is on tonight so I just relaxed feeling ebullient about my successful
                freshers week.

        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Thursday, 26th September</h2>
            <p>
                Since the same societies were occupying the DSU building, I was going to miss the final day of freshers
                since I have already signed up for half a dozen societies and clubs. However, the gentle persuasion of
                Hannah changed my mind. I met up with her and her friend Zed and checked out the DSU. Due to the
                declining interest, a number of societies decided the third day wasn’t worth it so the tables were only
                occupying two floors, not three. Since almost everyone I’ve met this week is doing English Literature or
                some other form of Humanities, I have plenty in common with them. Zed is a facsimile of me from first
                year. Very taciturn and when she does speak, it’s laconic and meticulous. If she could have it her way,
                she would be getting dragged around freshers by Hannah. Anyway, afterwards we had a brief lunch from one
                of the stalls. It was very insipid food which is to be expected from makeshift food stalls. I bade
                farewell as I wanted to play football this afternoon and needed to get back to change.
                <br><br>
                All the sessions at the Watershed are still part of the ‘taster experience’ therefore are free and no
                need to book. This is perhaps a hindrance rather than a benefit when thirty people show up to play in a
                meagre sized hall. The lads present were the same few who persuaded me to join the trials so they were
                easy to talk to. Because of the vast interest, more than half the allotted time my team sat on the
                bench. Nevermind. Some of the current futsal team were there and they were scouting new talent.
                <br><br>
                After a quick shower and a brisk walk back to the Watershed, I partook in my second yoga session of the
                week. In the normal timetable, Yoga will clash with the DMU Hackers meetings on Thursday nights so I’m
                the epitome of ‘here for a good time, not a long time’ type thing. There was much more interest in this
                session which is understandable now everyone is finding their feet around campus. Francesca messaged me
                as the class was finishing saying she was running late. Poor time-management is clearly one of her
                faults as she missed the entirety of the session. This could be perceived as divine intervention because
                I was caught in a thunderstorm on the way home. After camping out in the Watershed for ten minutes, it
                showed no signs of passing. Bravely wrapping up, I ran back to St Martins House but I was rightly soaked
                through. I do hope I don’t get a cold.

            <h2>Wednesday, 25th September</h2>
            <p>
                Before attending day two of the freshers fair, I picked up more essentials from town. Instead of doing
                one big shop, I’ve been doing it in stages. I also had another purpose for visiting town today: running
                trainers. I had been scouting the shops up north, but they were too dear, as Nana would say. Here, I
                have dedicated running shops and other independent retailers, which brought me an extended selection.
                The problem was, the prices skyrocketed in these retailers. Alas, I went to Sports Direct, even though I
                don’t like to support Mike Ashley. I managed to snag a pair of Asics for £64, which I think is
                reasonable. As long as I don’t go mad shopping in the next few weeks, I’ll be able to amortize the cost
                from the largesse of the parents.
                <br><br>
                The freshers fair was not as popular today compared to yesterday. The DSU was just as busy with
                societies, but the interest from the students had subsided. As promised, Dilan was there at the DMU
                Hackers table. We had a brief but interesting catch-up. He’s still at IBM until the end of the week, so
                it’s almost guaranteed that he’ll have a job after graduating. The Hackers meetings happen weekly,
                normally in Gateway House. Currently, that isn’t a problem, but during the second semester, I might have
                a seminar overlapping. Problem for later.
                <br><br>
                The most fortunate meeting of the day was seeing the stall for DMU Runners. This is a society that
                simply goes running together. Since I’ve just bought new Asics this morning, I thought it was prudent to
                have a chat with them. Coincidentally, they are meeting at the pub this evening to get to know the new
                intakes. More on this to come. Being circumspect, I said I’d think about it. That was because I had a
                previous engagement for this evening: yoga.
                <br><br>
                That’s right. I’m turning into a spiritual middle-aged man. I’ll be reading tea leaves and telling
                fortunes with a crystal ball if I’m not careful. Held at the Watershed, the session had only four others
                present. Strangely, all women; who’d have thought. The movements were slow and controlled. “It’s all
                about breathing out the bad energy and inhaling the good energy.” The session was an hour long, and we
                were doing all the classic poses: downward dog, the chair, deep lunge, the rag doll. Oh yeah, I’ve
                learnt a lot. We even meditated at the end; however, I admit I did find it difficult not to laugh during
                the silence at this new-age bollocks. “Focus on your breathing. Breathe in hopes and dreams. Breathe out
                negativity and impure thoughts.” What? Is this a front for a religious society now too?
                <br><br>
                I met Hannah and Francesca at this class. They’re starting their first year, both studying English
                Literature. Obviously, we had a lot of similar interests and have read almost identical books. Plenty of
                Dickens and Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.G. Wells, even Shakespeare. Who knows, there may even be hope
                yet of reciting Shakespeare monologues to each other.
                <br><br>
                After a quick shower and a bite to eat, I headed back into town to meet the runners at Soar Point. This
                is the go-to place for society socials because of the generous deals offered to students and also the
                large TV screens showing football. The Karting society has an arrangement with the staff to watch the F1
                there on Sundays too, as long as it doesn’t clash with the football. No doubt, I’ll be a regular if all
                goes well.
                <br><br>
                The Running Society is good fun. There is a good mix of people, boys and girls. Very affable. We played
                cards and Uno, spoke about our subjects, and shared our hobbies other than running. I was at the head of
                the table with the committee members: Katie and Lauren, who were the undersecretaries. Tobias, who had
                graduated last year, is a very funny man and also a paramedic, so he’s a handy friend to have. I was in
                the Soar till around eleven before we headed out to Firebug, another pub whose USP was offering a retro
                gaming experience whilst people drink. Mario Karts, Black Ops zombies, MW3. I felt a wave of nostalgia
                just seeing the consoles. It was just myself and the committee members who ventured to Firebug, as the
                rest took the long voyage to Black Cats, which was part of the Freshers experience. As a non-drinker, I
                haven’t invested the £40 in a wristband to get me access to these clubs, but I was content to stay with
                the runners. I heard the Running Society is well-run. Well run—see what I did there? They have a group
                running almost every night of the week, so we can pick and choose our days and distances. They also do
                social runs where they dress up, which will be … eventful.

            <h2>Tuesday, 24th September</h2>
            <p>
                Mark the date. My first attempt at being sociable. The DSU building was packed from the ground floor to
                the top with societies and sports teams, all trying to persuade you to join. No wonder I opted to avoid
                this in past years. This would have been an introvert's worst nightmare, having everyone asking
                questions and engaging in conversation. Now, however, I welcomed the challenge. After queuing for the
                best part of an hour to even get in, it was actually enjoyable because I had previously looked online at
                potential simpatico societies. The stalls I was actively looking for included: DMU Hackers (a computer
                science society), Karters (a go-karting club that holds socials where they watch F1 together), and Demon
                Media (the De Montfort magazine and radio proprietors). I thought this triumvirate would be a good place
                to start.
                <br><br>
                Having scoured from top to bottom, I found the latter two but no sign of DMU Hackers. Serendipitously, I
                ran into Dilan on my way home, who happens to be on the committee. The reason for their absence was due
                to a lack of space in the building, but they would be there tomorrow.
                <br><br>
                The Karters were a passionate bunch, and they all shared simpatico views on F1 as I did. This looks
                promising. I am less enthusiastic about Demon Media because the quality of the magazine looks mediocre.
                In conjunction with the poor design and large blank spaces permeating each page, the writing was subpar.
                I probably sound like Liam when I say that I could do a much more comprehensive job if I were to take
                over. Similarly to the futsal, I’m not looking for a heavy workload, just a medium in which I can
                publish a few articles now and again. The first meetings are happening next week, so I will definitely
                give them a go at least. On my way out, the Futsal society cornered me, and they didn’t let me bypass
                them without signing up for the trials happening in the next few weeks. It’s nice to be wanted.

                Back at St Martins House, a FIFA tournament was meant to be held, but the staff couldn’t work the TV, so
                that has been postponed till next week. Nevertheless, I held residence in the common room with a few
                others, enjoying the conviviality. There were Nigerians, Londoners, Brummies, and me—purposely confusing
                them all with my northern vernacular. “I canny see the point in gandering about for no reason like” was
                a personal favourite malapropism of mine. The look of bewilderment on their faces was amusing in itself.
                Anyway, I have gained a few more followers on Insta, so we can keep in touch. Overall, they seem like
                good people.

            <p>
                The first week of moving into new accommodation is always the most expensive. Stocking up on the
                essentials plus the weekly shop too, normally brings me to around £50 for the week. I was exhausted for
                some reason yesterday so I’ve been putting off the shopping and living on bread and the frozen foods
                which the local Tesco Express stocks. I was carrying out the menial tasks today such as updating my
                student card and re-registering for the forthcoming year so I was active anyway. The Diamond Jubilee
                Leisure centre is on the way to the big Tesco’s so I enquired about the free classes available to me.
                Unbeknownst to me, it was completely the wrong place, leaving the receptionist perplexed about my
                questions. Turns out, it’s actually the Watershed where the DMU Active session takes place - a DMU owned
                complex which has dedicated staff which also houses many of the sports societies too.
                <br><br>
                Following my productive conversation with the staff, I received a sheet with all the taster sessions on
                which would be happening throughout freshers. As futsal is the most popular, they are holding four
                sessions this week so everyone has a chance. No need to sign up or register. Just turn up and play.
                Simple. The futsal session was eventful. I wanted something relaxed, (if there is such a thing in
                football), to keep me active throughout the year. Evidently there must have been a few members of the
                DMU futsal squad there scouting because I’ve been ushered to go to the try-outs. I didn’t particularly
                think my performance was as good as it normally is but the enthusiasm which the players had when
                speaking about my skill was too ingratiating for me to say no. I guess I’ll be playing competitive
                futsal this year…
                <br><br>
                My third flatmate moved in today too - Esther. She’s studying microbiology at UOL so I’m not sure how
                much I’ll see of her. She seems congenial like Summer but I still don’t know how close we are all going
                to be.

            <h2>Saturday, 21st September</h2>
            <p>
                Today, the first day of my journey through my final year at university. After bidding adieu to the
                parents from my new apartment building, I was able to explore. Being located almost centrally to
                everywhere I go is ideal but the longer journey to the Tesco Superstore may become irksome after a
                while. But for now, I am satisfied with my room; the bed is springy but it’s one of those things I’ll
                have to live with. Also from having brief chats with the staff at the reception, this location is
                normally quiet due to the reduced number of rooms compared to their sister buildings. My only roommate
                at the moment seems cordial which is all I can ask for at this point. I just hope this ‘university
                experience’ which I so craved does not come to bite me on the arse because down the road when I have a
                full apartment.
