            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    What a week. I'm writing this retrospectively, now back home after the trip wrapped up on Friday. My
                    original plan was to blog daily - just like I did in Sicily - but it quickly became clear that free
                    time in Paris would be a luxury I wouldn’t have. When I wasn't busy with the pre-planned activities
                    organised by DMU, I was either out exploring the city or spending time with the others on the trip.
                    Socialising wasn’t something I’d anticipated doing much of, but it turned out to be one of the most
                    enjoyable parts of the experience - as you’ll see in the entries that follow. So, let’s dive in.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Monday, 7th April</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a seasoned traveller. Trains haven’t made me nervous since I started flying, and even air travel
                    feels routine now. Especially after spending my erasmus year bouncing from capital to capital. St
                    Pancras International, however, always delivers its own brand of chaos. The departure lounge is more
                    of a bottleneck than a waiting area - a cramped petri dish of oversized luggage, restless
                    passengers, and general frustration.
                    <br><br>
                    I met the rest of the DMU group in the main concourse. None of us knew each other - students pulled
                    together from different faculties and year groups. The only thing we had in common was our desire to
                    see Paris. Natalia and Phil, our trip leads, decided we’d move through security and passport control
                    as a unit, probably to avoid losing anyone before we even left the country. With our A4-printed
                    tickets in hand, we made it through the checks in about 20 minutes, leaving over an hour to wait.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t like waiting. I intentionally got a later train to the others travelling from Leicester so I
                    wouldn’t need to be sat in the station for two hours. Little did I know that everyone would be
                    waiting for me before security instead of in the comfort of the departure lounge.
                    <br><br>
                    True to form, I drifted off to find a quiet seat and bury myself in a book. That didn’t last long. A
                    chatty American named Silas broke the silence. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, he was on a
                    university trip too - his route covered Madrid, Paris, Brussels, and London. Clearly American
                    colleges have deeper pockets; maybe Trump’s tariffs finally paid for something. I tried to sidestep
                    touchy topics - politics, guns, Trump - but he brought them up anyway, and to my surprise, he had a
                    pretty liberal take on most of it. Maybe not all <em>deep-south</em>Americans are parochial bigots
                    afterall.
                    <br><br>
                    As for the Eurostar itself? Just another train. I’m not sure what everyone expected. We lost track
                    of our location every time we emerged from a tunnel, but otherwise, it was as uneventful as any
                    other journey. Gare du Nord had the same look and feel as most big-city stations - crowded, slightly
                    chaotic. Apart from a couple of our group wandering off in search for metro tickets, we were quickly
                    rounded up and shepherded onto the Metro. Within an hour, we were checked into our hotel near Jardin
                    du Luxembourg.
                    <br><br>
                    The first night was all about getting a feel for the place. Owen, my roommate for the week, and I
                    headed out in search of food, like scavengers on the hunt. I was craving something familiar - maybe
                    a Starbucks, or a Caffè Nero - but by the time we ventured out, the sun had set and most shops had
                    closed. So, McDonald’s it was. Not exactly gourmet, but familiar enough. I don’t really eat fast
                    food back home, so I can’t compare across borders - but for the record, it was bad. Really bad.
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t go anywhere without my camera, so I was snapping photos as soon as I could. Even in the
                    dark, the Panthéon was a paragon of architectural effulgence, its façade glowing under the Parisian
                    night sky. Exploring the area, we met up with some of the others standing in line outside a
                    restaurant that had gone viral on TikTok. Apparently that’s the new Michelin star. I stood in the
                    queue with them for all of a few minutes, still unsure of everyone’s names, knowing full well I
                    wouldn’t be ordering anything - my eating habits don’t exactly align with trendy French menus. So I
                    dipped.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe I should’ve stayed. It would’ve been the sociable thing to do - chat, bond, integrate - but I
                    was still in the mindset that I had just four full days in Paris. Spending the first night stuck in
                    a restaurant didn’t feel like the best use of my time. So, I hopped on the Metro and headed for the
                    beating heart of the city.
                    <br><br>
                    It was already nearing 10 p.m., when I emerged at Pont des Arts. I was in full tourist mode, taking
                    photos of everything - the architecture, the glowing bridges, the flags fluttering along the
                    riverbanks. The Eiffel Tower, one of the tallest structures in central Paris, is visible from almost
                    every vantage point in the city, but I hadn’t yet found my bearings. I decided to walk to it,
                    assuming it was only about twenty minutes away.
                    <br><br>
                    An hour later, I finally arrived. I stood on the grass with the Eiffel Tower sparkling above me. I
                    have photos from every angle along the way. The Tower sparkles every hour for only five minutes. It
                    was close to midnight when I finally sat down to rest.
                    <br><br>
                    Reading my Kindle at midnight beneath a glittering Eiffel Tower felt like a scene pulled straight
                    from a film. Perfect serenity. Not a cloud in the sky. Just the gentle whistle of birds and the
                    distant hush of the city. The world; completely at peace.

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Tuesday, 8th April</h2>
                <p>
                    The official purpose of the trip was networking and showcasing our value to potential employers - or
                    at least, that was the official tagline being pushed. This included participating in two
                    industry-led tasks, the first of which was hosted by Tanium, a cybersecurity and IT solutions firm
                    based in the western quarter of Paris.
                    <br><br>
                    As with all school-style excursions, we moved as one group. The plan was straightforward: hop on a
                    couple of metros and head to Tanium’s HQ. Simple enough. Except I made the rookie error of wearing
                    the wrong shoes and needed to duck into a pharmacy for plasters. I was in and out in under thirty
                    seconds, but when I returned to the street - poof - the group had vanished.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, I probably should’ve just made my own way there and spared the group the drama. But I
                    messaged the group chat to say I’d be late, and that’s when everything spiralled. Phil and Natalia
                    realised I was missing - just as they were boarding the metro - and mild panic ensued.
                    <br><br>
                    I was perfectly capable of navigating the Paris Metro alone, but Phil insisted on meeting me at the
                    interchange. If you’ve ever tried to find someone in a busy train station, you’ll know it’s a
                    logistical nightmare. We were exchanging messages like a tactical ops team - he said, “Meet me at
                    the top of the escalators.” There were five sets of escalators.
                    <br><br>
                    I gave up on the wild goose chase and headed to the platform where I knew our connecting train would
                    arrive. I told Phil to meet me there. It took three trains and a lot of back-and-forth before he
                    finally spotted me, standing exactly where I said I’d be. Reunited at last, we boarded the next
                    metro and carried on.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite Tanium’s roots in cybersecurity and tech, our focus was more on the business and marketing
                    side of things. After a brief presentation - complete with company secrets and a behind-the-scenes
                    look at their operations - we were handed our task.
                    <br><br>
                    The challenge came in the form of three A4 sheets listing landmarks, objects, lookalikes, and
                    activities we had to photograph (or in some cases, purchase). The landmarks were the usual suspects:
                    Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and so on. Bonus points if we managed to rope in
                    unsuspecting strangers to pose with us.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there were the objects - your classic Parisian staples: berets, croissants, tiny Eiffel Tower
                    souvenirs. Easy enough. The activities, however, were something else entirely. One item suggested
                    getting a group of ten to twenty Parisians to do a can-can - or worse, a game of
                    Ring-a-ring-o'-roses. Slightly ambitious, to say the least. Each item on the list carried a
                    different point value: landmarks were worth an average of three points, while the high-risk group
                    activities could net you up to twenty.
                    <br><br>
                    For the entire week we were operating in the same teams of four. In true Apprentice fashion we even
                    had motivational names. Team Empowered consisted of myself, Amy, Brittany & Maria. In the interest
                    of covering more ground, we split up into pairs. I teamed up with Amy - a final-year HR student with
                    an exceptional sense of direction. Ideal. We divided the list and plotted our course. It was a
                    semi-structured plan, cobbled together with the help of ChatGPT as our unofficial tour guide.
                    <br><br>
                    In every selfie, we had to include two things: a small French flag we’d been handed, and an A4
                    printout of James - the trip’s original organiser, who had to drop out last minute. So, in spirit at
                    least, he made it into all the photos.
                    <br><br>
                    As if that wasn’t enough, each pair was also given a single raw egg before we set off. We assumed
                    the egg had to appear in the photos too, and treated it like some odd scavenger hunt prop. Only
                    later did we learn the egg was symbolic - meant to discourage us from sprinting through the streets
                    like lunatics. Of course, no one told us that upfront. So there we were, proudly holding up this egg
                    in selfie after selfie like it was some kind of sacred artifact.
                    <br><br>
                    I wouldn’t have minded the egg situation so much - if not for the unfortunate chain of events that
                    led to its premature demise. It started with my Metro travel card refusing to work properly, and was
                    made worse when Amy, thinking we were clear, pulled the turnstile ahead of me. In a moment of pure
                    improvisation, I attempted to leap over it but my athletic prowess didn’t do me justice. A gooey
                    mess of egg, neatly shattered and contained within the pocket of my khakis. To add insult to injury,
                    the turnstile smacked me in the thigh - hard enough to make it feel like I’d pulled a muscle.
                    <br><br>
                    Breaking the egg within the first twenty minutes of the challenge wasn’t exactly a promising start.
                    Replacing it proved harder than expected - we were in the high-end fashion district, flanked by
                    Burberry, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger. Not a supermarket in sight. Apparently, eggs don’t exist
                    in luxury retail zones.
                    <br><br>
                    We had roughly four hours to complete the challenge. Thankfully, Amy and I made a solid team - and
                    if nothing else, it was an excellent icebreaker. About an hour before the deadline, we found
                    ourselves lounging in the gardens in front of the Louvre, eating lunch and chatting like we’d known
                    each other for years. The task itself, while odd at first, turned out to be far more enjoyable than
                    I’d anticipated - mostly thanks to Amy’s good humour and easygoing nature.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, a few quarrels.
                    <br><br>
                    As much fun as it was racing around Paris snapping photos and ticking off objectives, I struggled to
                    see how this connected to anything Tanium-related. Their justification was that it tested our
                    ability to manage tasks and prioritise. A bit of a stretch - but sure, I’ll play along.
                    <br><br>
                    My second gripe is more personal. We’d covered nearly every quarter of Paris, yet I hadn’t taken a
                    single proper photo on my camera. We were so focused on completing the checklist - snapping a selfie
                    and moving on - that I missed the chance to actually see Paris through my own lens. In that sense,
                    the day felt a little wasted.
                    <br><br>
                    The final rendezvous point was a hotel bar overlooking the western quarter of the city. We were
                    expected to arrive by 3:30 p.m. - with a 10% points deduction hanging over us if we were late. It
                    was an open bar and this was where the networking would come into play. Tony and Lawrence were the
                    architects behind the challenges and they were eager to hear how we’d done. They were also offering
                    advice and introductions if we wanted with department heads within the company. I’m sure linkedIn
                    profiles were exchanged but I was busy taking images of the sky high view of Paris. Despite not
                    checking off everything on the list, we still had stories to tell about our travels.
                    <br><br>
                    I think it was after the task that the group really started to click. The Eiffel Tower at sunset is
                    one of those moments you don’t want to miss - partly for the experience, partly out of sheer FOMO. I
                    was heading out in just a T-shirt until I noticed how dressed up everyone else was. A quick pitstop
                    back to the hotel for a shirt, and we were off.
                    <br><br>
                    Our destination: the Musée de l'Homme, which sits directly across from the Eiffel Tower - perfect
                    for watching it glisten as the sun dipped below the skyline.
                    <br><br>
                    As always, where I went, my camera went too. I’d unofficially become the group’s designated
                    photographer. Thankfully, Owen and Amy stepped up as my quasi-photographers for the evening,
                    managing to catch a few action shots of me in return. I learnt a few things whilst doing the
                    photoshoots. Like Amy has eyes like a siren. The deepest blue eyes I have ever seen. Mae on the
                    other hand is the most photogenic person I’ve ever met. With every photo looking so professional,
                    she makes me look like a good photographer. When I come to distribute these photos, I wouldn’t be
                    surprised if the individual shots are used as LinkedIn profile pictures since everyone was dressed
                    up for the occasion.
                    <br><br>
                    Dining abroad is always a gamble, especially for someone with picky tastes. I’d stocked up on a pack
                    of pain au chocolat from a local supermarket earlier in the day - my go-to snack whenever I was back
                    in the room. So when we headed to an Italian restaurant that evening, I was there strictly for the
                    social aspect. When the food arrived, I politely passed and pulled out my Kindle instead.
                    <br><br>
                    After dinner, we made a quick detour to the Arc de Triomphe before hopping on the Metro back to the
                    hotel. Ironically, even though I didn’t take a single photo of the landmarks during the Tanium task,
                    I somehow ended up with over two hundred photos from that Eiffel Tower outing alone.

                <h2>Wednesday, 9th April</h2>
                <p>
                    It became apparent by Wednesday morning that the previous day’s exertions had taken their toll -
                    most of the group had opted for a late start. I was the sole figure in the breakfast hall,
                    collecting my usual croissant and pain au chocolat before heading out just after half past eight.
                    <br><br>
                    Before arriving in Paris, I had a loose itinerary in mind - landmarks I wanted to see, streets I
                    wanted to walk, spaces I hoped to encounter quietly. This was my only unscheduled day, and I
                    intended to make the most of it.
                    <br><br>
                    I wandered through some of Paris’s most storied quarters - The Panthéon, Notre-Dame, the Bastille,
                    Sainte-Chapelle, the Centre Pompidou, and the Jardin des Plantes among them. The aim was simple:
                    revisit many of the places I’d sped past during the challenge and take proper photographs - ones
                    that weren’t rushed, that allowed the architecture and ambiance to breathe. Perhaps I would have
                    preferred company, someone to frame in the shots, but from what I’d heard, few people were even
                    awake before eleven.
                    <br><br>
                    Mae and Jess had queued to ascend the Eiffel Tower, but news soon circulated that the lift had
                    broken just as they reached the front - resulting in an even longer wait for the remaining one. In
                    that moment, my decision to explore solo felt quietly vindicated.
                    <br><br>
                    In the northeast quarter, the city reveals its more familiar, everyday self. Unlike the luxury
                    enclaves Amy and I had wandered through during the scavenger hunt, this area was grounded - its
                    shops frequented by actual Parisians rather than tourists. Châtelet–Les Halles, an enormous
                    subterranean shopping complex, was every bit as labyrinthine as I’d anticipated. Joules happened to
                    be having a major sale, and in retrospect, purchasing only one shirt at 70% off now seems like a
                    tactical error.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in the afternoon, I’d promised Abbey I’d accompany her to the Musée d’Orsay. On the way, I
                    made a brief detour to the Eiffel Tower to finally photograph it in daylight - another moment that
                    had escaped me during the previous day’s sprint. Then came a slow, idyllic walk along the Seine
                    toward the museum.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, I had underestimated the significance of the Orsay’s collection. Van Gogh, Monet,
                    Renoir - icons of European art - and all displayed with an intimacy that digital reproductions fail
                    to capture. Abbey and I wandered the galleries like children in a sweetshop, pausing to appreciate
                    brushwork, colour, light. We discovered we had a surprising number of shared interests -
                    unsurprising, perhaps, given our mutual draw to art and history. Abbey’s esoteric knowledge of the
                    sixteenth-century Spanish Empire turned what could have been a typical museum visit into something
                    more dynamic. I contributed where I could - recalling bits and pieces about Isabel and Ferdinand
                    from books I’d read - our conversation flowing as naturally as the Seine just beyond the gallery
                    walls. As she’s a first year CyberSecurity student, I could impart some of my wisdom about the
                    faculty and give some helpful tips and tricks I’ve picked up throughout my course.
                    <br><br>
                    Lunch, on this particular afternoon, was an unfortunate misstep. Nestled in the gardens between the
                    Place de la Concorde and the Louvre sits a quaint café - modest, charming, and previously a welcome
                    oasis. Amy and I had stopped there the day before, enjoying toasted sandwiches and delicate
                    patisserie as a much-needed reprieve from the whirlwind of the task. Today, it served as a brief
                    interlude before Abbey’s scheduled visit to the Louvre. Unfortunately, I opted for a hotdog - a
                    regrettable decision. Its nauseating flavour lingered longer than it had any right to, and were it
                    not for Abbey’s comforting presence and easy conversation, I suspect I might have spiralled into a
                    quiet panic.
                    <br><br>
                    By that point, I had already walked over 25,000 steps. Sitting by the fountains, watching children
                    sail remote-control boats across the still water, offered exactly the kind of stillness I needed. A
                    moment to rest. There was a gentle calm in the air, a shared sense of pause. Abbey’s company, and
                    later Jess’s, only enhanced that moment of serenity.
                    <br><br>
                    The girls were scheduled to enter the Louvre at four, which gave them a generous window to explore
                    its storied halls. I hadn’t been as fortunate - unable to secure a ticket for their time slot, or
                    any at all for that matter, as the museum was fully booked for the remainder of the week. So I set
                    out alone once more, this time toward Montmartre - Paris’s artistic citadel, perched high on its
                    northern hill and gazing out across the city.
                    <br><br>
                    The walk was long - an hour or so - but walking rarely fazes me. With my camera slung across my
                    shoulder, I passed down the Champs-Élysées, traced the grand steps of the Opéra Garnier, and
                    wandered every floor of Galeries Lafayette, letting the route wind and meander as much as it wanted.
                    Eventually, I reached the steps of Sacré-Cœur, where the city unfurled beneath me in hues of gold
                    and grey.
                    <br><br>
                    I could have lingered there for hours, breathing in the atmosphere of painters, poets, and quiet
                    wanderers. But the only scheduled obligation of the day loomed - the alumni dinner at half past
                    seven. As much as I had revelled in my solitary exploration, I made my way to the Metro, camera in
                    tow, and headed back across the city.
                    <br><br>
                    Much like the first night, I wouldn’t be eating. The menu rarely aligned with my tastes, but my
                    attendance was gently insisted upon. A show of respect. A presence to avoid appearing impolite in
                    front of the alumni who had generously made the effort to join us.
                    <br><br>
                    When I arrived - fashionably late, of course - there was only a single alumnus present, which
                    lessened any guilt I might’ve felt for my tardiness. Much like the other dinners, I kept myself
                    occupied with my Kindle, occasionally slipping away for a brief wander through the northeast quarter
                    of Paris. The streets were alive with a palpable energy - PSG were playing, and the distant roar of
                    crowds and scattered cheers echoed through the avenues like thunder rolling across cobblestones.
                    <br><br>
                    Paris at sunset truly is a spectacle. The golden light casts long shadows between Haussmannian
                    facades, and the breeze drifting through the tight lattice of boulevards offered a welcome reprieve
                    from the oppressive heat of the day. What sets Paris apart from other European capitals - Prague,
                    Milan, even Stockholm - is how unrelentingly beautiful it is. Every corner of the city holds
                    something of cultural or architectural value. You can barely walk ten minutes in any direction
                    without stumbling upon a monument, museum, or some corner of history proudly on display.
                    <br><br>
                    After dessert, I returned from my little detour to rejoin the group at the restaurant. The remainder
                    of the evening was mostly uneventful - everyone slowly trickled back to the hotel, worn out from the
                    day’s excursions. I, however, opted to get off the Metro a few stops early, keen to make the most of
                    the warm evening and the rare solitude.
                    <br><br>
                    Camera in hand, I wandered the Île de la Cité and Île Saint-Louis, tracing the quiet bridges and
                    narrow lanes by moonlight. Pont des Arts - once known for its sea of padlocks - now stands barer,
                    though a few stubborn tokens remain, clinging to the railings like memories that refuse to fade.
                    There was a certain poetry in the emptiness. I managed to capture a few striking shots of Paris at
                    night - shadows, reflections, stillness. The city feels entirely different after dark. Calmer. More
                    honest, somehow.

                <h2>Thursday, 10th April</h2>
                <p>
                    Mornings alone in the breakfast room had become something of a ritual. While most people clung to
                    those extra twenty minutes of sleep, I was up by half seven like clockwork. On mornings like today,
                    when the itinerary didn’t kick off until later, I used the time for early excursions - this time to
                    the Luxembourg Gardens. I wanted to catch the park before it filled with joggers, dog walkers, and
                    tourists wielding selfie sticks. A quiet photo session in the morning light, before we set off for
                    the Enterprise HQ, gave me the space to breathe and properly absorb where I was.
                    <br><br>
                    The Enterprise offices were nestled in the southwestern quarter of Paris. Enterprise is one of those
                    companies that lives quietly in the periphery of your awareness - utterly invisible until someone
                    brings up car rentals. As with Tanium, we were welcomed with a company presentation, which quickly
                    veered into corporate recruitment territory. The speaker, a recruiter by title, had the cadence and
                    delivery of a struggling YouTuber asking viewers to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon - for
                    Enterprise. The entire pitch teetered on the edge of desperation.
                    <br><br>
                    For the next thirty minutes, Hassan, our presenter, walked us through the “incredibly
                    straightforward” process of applying for their graduate scheme. He even guided us through the steps
                    on how to sign up. A generous use of our time, indeed. But here’s where my skepticism kicked in. The
                    positions he was highlighting? Field sales roles. The kind of job where you stand at airport kiosks
                    or outside train stations, trying to convince groggy travellers to hire a car. Perhaps I’m being
                    cynical - or, as he might say, “closed off to opportunity” - but I’d hazard a guess that most of us
                    didn’t spend three years on degree courses to peddle car rentals with laminated pamphlets. The only
                    semi-redeeming factor? A chance to live and work in Paris. Still, that’s a hard sell.
                    <br><br>
                    As the sales pitch wrapped up, Hassan introduced a lineup of senior staff from the Enterprise Paris
                    office. Titles like Head of Sales for Northern France, Marketing Manager, Account Manager. One by
                    one they entered: each a variant of the same archetype - middle-aged, English, armed with
                    self-assured grins and swaggering postures. I wouldn’t normally raise an eyebrow, but this came
                    directly after Hassan’s ten-minute monologue on the company’s commitment to inclusivity and
                    diversity. What followed was, quite literally, five versions of the same man.
                    <br><br>
                    The Enterprise task skewed far more academic than Tanium’s, which meant we were confined to the
                    slightly airless sterility of the office for most of the day. Our mission: to concoct a hypothetical
                    launch of <em>Enterprise Car Club</em> in a UK city of our choosing. This involved assembling a
                    group presentation that combined market research, logistical analysis, and a vaguely creative
                    marketing campaign. Since marketing isn’t exactly my forte - or interest - I took charge of the
                    introduction and made the case for our chosen city: Newcastle. A logical pick, not least because I
                    had some local knowledge to pad out my section. The rest of the team pulled their weight admirably.
                    Maria, for instance, had already completed a similar exercise as part of an Enterprise career event
                    in Leicester, and Brittany, a second-year law student, brought her trademark precision to the
                    marketing strategy.
                    <br><br>
                    After every team had presented, the evaluation was handed over to Hassan and Fabrice. Fabrice,
                    incidentally, was the only actual Parisian we encountered at the Paris office; everyone else had
                    been shipped in from across the UK, as the office was still in its fledgling stages. The feedback,
                    if one could call it that, was where things began to unravel. The winning team, according to Hassan
                    and Fabrice, triumphed not on the strength of their strategy, clarity of presentation, or grasp of
                    the task, but because they introduced themselves. That was it. Apparently, in the eyes of two
                    marketing professionals, a self-introduction carried more weight than the substance of the content
                    itself. No critique of our ideas, no commentary on innovation, just applause for basic etiquette. It
                    was, to put it lightly, absurd.
                    <br><br>
                    We left Enterprise with the unmistakable feeling that we’d done more to bolster Hassan’s LinkedIn
                    credentials than he had to bolster our career prospects. Every time a higher-up entered the room to
                    tell their well-rehearsed career story, Hassan made a point of reintroducing himself, as though
                    auditioning for a promotion. The entire experience felt steeped in corporate nostalgia - an
                    organisational culture that hadn’t quite progressed beyond the late 1990s. The atmosphere was
                    saturated with “bro” culture, subtle swagger, and a brand of confidence found almost exclusively in
                    middle-aged men who've only ever known one company.
                    <br><br>
                    Enterprise’s policy of promoting exclusively from within may sound admirable in theory, but in
                    practice, it’s stifling. It’s how you end up with a management team that looks and thinks the same:
                    white, male, and largely untested outside of their internal echo chamber. While this closed-loop
                    system might be efficient for internal progression, it was painfully clear from the outside that it
                    had bred a fishbowl mentality - one that discourages fresh perspectives and curtails innovation.
                    There’s a kind of corporate comfort in sameness, but to me, it only highlighted the dangers of never
                    stepping outside your own walls.
                    <br><br>
                    After two days immersed in both structured activities and the low-level chaos of corporate tasks,
                    the group dynamic had solidified. Familiarity bred not contempt, but camaraderie, and I found myself
                    increasingly inclined to spend my free time with the same people I’d once politely nodded to in
                    silence. Following the protracted Enterprise session - where morale had taken a corporate-shaped
                    beating - we gravitated toward the Luxembourg Gardens for some overdue decompression.
                    <br><br>
                    The gardens themselves are a curious institution. Despite their sprawling lawns, sitting on the
                    grass is strictly prohibited. Enforcers patrol the grounds with the intensity of parkland sentinels
                    - gardeners elevated to minor authority figures. Instead, metal café chairs are strategically
                    scattered around the periphery like socially sanctioned islands of repose. That’s where we gathered:
                    Jess, Amy, Owen, Mae, and myself. We whiled away the early evening playing UNO, taking photos, and
                    swapping stories - the kind of mellow ritual that usually takes place around a campfire, not in the
                    middle of a Parisian park under surveillance.
                    <br><br>
                    At some point during this mellow gathering, we requested feedback from our trip lead, Phil, on the
                    Enterprise presentations - since the Enterprise staff had been singularly unhelpful in this regard.
                    Phil described my performance as one of “quiet confidence” with the cautionary note to avoid tipping
                    into apathy. An oddly specific phrasing, though not unfamiliar; I’d received almost identical
                    feedback from an employer the week before. Perhaps there's a pattern forming - one that suggests
                    equilibrium isn't always easily distinguishable from disengagement.
                    <br><br>
                    Our intention had been to dine at a reasonable hour - around 7 p.m. - followed by a night out for
                    those feeling particularly ambitious. Predictably, that plan dissolved. Instead, we chose prudence,
                    returning to the hotel to pack in anticipation of an early checkout. Technically, 10 a.m. isn’t
                    early, but it is when you're crawling in at 4 a.m.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually, we made it to the restaurant at around ten, and I was ravenous - less from hunger than
                    from a desperate need for something that wasn’t a croissant. The venue was chosen deliberately for
                    its extensive menu and, I suspect, to appease my ever-narrowing dietary patience. I opted for the
                    humble chicken burger, assuming safety in simplicity. It arrived cloaked in a firestorm of spice -
                    an unadvertised surprise. Fortunately, Amy and Mae came to my aid, kindly sharing their more
                    palatable dishes. After three days of increasingly unfiltered interactions, sharing food had become
                    less an act of generosity and more a symbol of collective survival. Mae, it turned out, was a fellow
                    slow eater and very empathetic to my bizarre eating rituals. Jess, ever the culinary daredevil,
                    sampled mussels in a snail sauce - an act of bravery that confirmed her status as the most
                    gastronomically intrepid among us.
                    <br><br>
                    We left the restaurant well past midnight - an hour later than we’d planned to be at the club. The
                    venue Amy had found, TikTok-famous and vaguely mythologised in our group chat, was nestled near the
                    Bastille. Naturally, it was also a forty-minute walk from our current location. Abbey and Jess, ever
                    the paragons of good sense, opted to call it a night. Mae, Amy, and I, on the other hand,
                    surrendered to the recklessness that only travel and temporary friendships permit. We escorted the
                    others back to the hotel and, at the unfashionably late hour of 1 a.m., finally set off for
                    Pachamama.
                    <br><br>
                    A short bus ride and a bleary-eyed walk later, we arrived. The lore surrounding Pachamama described
                    a decadent, multi-levelled wonder - six floors of music, movement, and mood. Reality, as it often
                    does, presented a compromise. The structure did indeed have six floors, each technically housing a
                    bar, but functionally, the club consisted of one central dance floor on the ground level, with the
                    remaining tiers arranged as mezzanine balconies that overlooked the chaos below. Each was scattered
                    with armchairs and velvet sofas, exuding more parlour-room than party-zone energy. As it was a
                    Thursday, the top three floors were closed - a quiet casualty of midweek nightlife.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t drink, but I do dance. And though cocktails were priced at a sobering €15, which
                    significantly curbed Mae and Amy’s enthusiasm for the bar, the lack of alcohol did nothing to dim
                    our enjoyment. I’m not sure if it was the context - being in Paris, being surrounded by people I
                    felt entirely myself around - but the memory of that night far outshone the clubbing experiences of
                    my teenage years. Back then, in the claustrophobic nightlife of Darlington, I would often find
                    myself huddled in corners beside friends more interested in drinking and smoking weed than in
                    dancing. That version of clubbing - detached, joyless - never resonated. I haven’t seen those people
                    in four years, not since leaving for university. I stand by that decision.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, Amy and Mae danced because they wanted to. I danced because I wanted to. We were united
                    in our intent to enjoy ourselves, and in that space - underneath ornate ceilings and moody red
                    lights - it felt like we were.
                    <br><br>
                    We had intended to leave by three. At four, we emerged, bleary-eyed and satisfied, onto the quiet
                    Parisian street. Mae, delightfully tipsy, leaned on us for support. Fortunately, the buses run
                    through the night, sparing us the prospect of a forty-minute trek back to the hotel. Typically, the
                    journey home is an epilogue - not particularly memorable. But this one offered a charming twist.
                    <br><br>
                    Mae drifted to sleep against my shoulder, while Amy met what we described as “the love of her life.”
                    A Parisian, naturally - wavy hair, linen shirt, and an air of studied nonchalance. Their entire
                    interaction lasted no more than five minutes, marked by the comedic choreography of swaying bus
                    movements and flirtatious smiles exchanged between stops. It was the opening scene of a romantic
                    comedy, minus the second act. When our stop arrived, we disembarked, leaving behind nothing more
                    than a series of blurry photos and a wistful sense of what-if. Amy has since tasked me with the
                    Herculean feat of finding her midnight stranger. Difficult, certainly - but not impossible.
                    <br><br>
                    The three of us walked the final stretch back to the hotel, replaying Amy’s five-minute romance with
                    the delight of schoolchildren analysing a crush. It was silly. It was fleeting. But that, in many
                    ways, is the point of nights like these.

                <h2>Friday, 10th April</h2>
                <p>
                    On less than three hours of sleep, I was still - somehow - deluded enough to attend breakfast at 8
                    a.m. My reward was a modest collection of pastries, which I spirited back upstairs as an offering to
                    our sleep-deprived selves. I vaguely remember speaking with Phil, our ever-optimistic trip lead, but
                    I couldn’t tell you a word of what was said. Fatigue had reduced the entire exchange to a dreamlike
                    blur.
                    <br><br>
                    Checkout was mercifully smooth. Our luggage was tucked away in a spare breakfast room, sparing us
                    the indignity of wheeling our suitcases through the streets like weary tourists. It was our final
                    day, and one final task remained - a kind of swan song to our time in Paris. The location: Jardin du
                    Luxembourg.
                    <br><br>
                    The challenge was eccentric in design. We were given a list of ten obscure questions from Natalia,
                    each requiring some degree of investigative footwork through the park. How many defibrillators were
                    installed? What local sports club used the park as a training centre? True to form, Team Empowered
                    split up to cover more ground. Amy and I ambled through the gardens on a quest that felt part
                    scavenger hunt, part bureaucratic farce.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite our best efforts - and admittedly, a pace dictated more by exhaustion than efficiency - we
                    completed the list, only to discover we were significantly behind the others. The next phase
                    demanded we guess a number between one and ten to earn the next location clue. We guessed wrong.
                    Naturally. What followed was a prolonged bout of trivia purgatory, a seemingly endless barrage of
                    questions designed more to provoke existential doubt than test knowledge. All of this, I might add,
                    while severely sleep-deprived and quickly losing the will to feign enthusiasm.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually, we were granted mercy and permitted to leave the park. Our next stop was Jardins des
                    Plantes, where Phil awaited, armed with yet another challenge: deciphering an acronym that spelled
                    “Notre-Dame.” In theory, this could have been enjoyable. In practice, we were too far behind to make
                    any meaningful attempt. The temptation to abandon the exercise entirely and reclaim what little time
                    remained in Paris was overwhelming.
                    <br><br>
                    I should note that our liberation from the game was not entirely voluntary. I was, quite literally,
                    escorted out of the park. Snapping photos at an expeditious rate, Amy, Maria, Brittany and I made
                    our way to Notre-Dame, a fitting final destination, even if we arrived at it more through attrition
                    than victory.
                    <br><br>
                    Unsurprisingly, we came last.
                    <br><br>
                    But no matter - it was an arbitrary challenge anyway. A few final words from Natalia and Phil and we
                    were free to enjoy what little time left we had in the capital. The rest of the day unfolded at a
                    gentler pace than the ones before it. By now, I had walked most of Paris, and I’d seen everything I
                    was going to see. I hadn’t ventured inside the Louvre nor ascended the Eiffel Tower, but I’d made
                    peace with that. Some icons are better left as silhouettes on the skyline.
                    <br><br>
                    Lunch was a quieter affair. Abbey and I sought out a little bakery, the kind that smells of flour
                    and warmth, and collected fresh baguettes. The others had opted for something more adventurous -
                    ramen noodles, I think - but I was perfectly content with the simplicity. Abbey, a first-year Cyber
                    Security student, carries a composure and maturity far beyond her eighteen years. Much wiser than I
                    was at that age. (And brighter, too, by several degrees.) We sat by the Seine, eating our bread and
                    watching the boats cruise past, the Parisian breeze offering a final act of hospitality.
                    <br><br>
                    Jess arrived to whisk Abbey off for some last-minute shopping; I wandered back toward the group,
                    reuniting at the restaurant. Mae was fighting the demons of her hangover, while Amy remained, as
                    ever, impervious to fatigue. The afternoon slipped into a lull. We deposited Mae on a park bench,
                    where she promptly fell asleep. Amy and I wandered near Notre-Dame, and I took what I knew would be
                    my final few photos - trying to memorise the gothic curves of the cathedral, already knowing the
                    images wouldn't do it justice.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually, we regrouped and wandered to another park. There, under the waning afternoon sun,
                    everyone except me fell into a light sleep on the grass. I stayed awake, flicking through the 900
                    photos I'd taken, pausing occasionally to photograph the pigeons. Not just any pigeons -
                    <em>French</em> pigeons. There’s a difference, I’m convinced.
                    <br><br>
                    The walk back to the hotel felt tinged with something difficult to define - a quiet blend of
                    consternation and contentment. We were leaving. Not just Paris, but one another. What began as a
                    trip to explore Parisian landmarks had, somewhere along the way, shifted its focus. It had become
                    something else entirely - something people-oriented.
                    <br><br>
                    The Eurostar home was a blur of laughter and lethargy. Everyone was drained. Mae, Amy, and I
                    especially. But none of us were willing to let go just yet. We played cards, told riddles, and
                    invented games - trying to squeeze out every remaining moment.

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been sceptical of people who describe a single weekend away or a short holiday as <em>the
                    best time of their lives. </em>It always struck me as a little... empty. A sign that maybe the
                    everyday parts of life lack fulfilment, that the bar for joy is set too low. But now, a few days
                    after returning from Paris, I find myself reaching for similar language. Maybe I’m one of those
                    people now - maybe I do need more joy, more colour in the routine.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the week, I prioritised movement over immersion. I saw the city by walking through it,
                    rather than queuing up for its most famous interiors. And I don’t regret that. Time was short. I
                    don’t mourn skipping the Eiffel Tower, though I do slightly wish I’d gone into the Louvre with the
                    others that Wednesday. Still, I can say - without hyperbole - that these few days have been some of
                    the best of my life. Not because I was in Paris (though it’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve
                    seen), and not because of the sunshine - but because of the people. Each one distinct. Each one
                    surprisingly easy to laugh with.
                    <br><br>
                    Before the trip, I assumed I’d keep to myself. I usually do. I expected to politely slip away
                    whenever I could, just like I did that first night. Paris had too much to offer, and I didn’t want
                    to compromise. I’ve always told myself I don’t need others to enjoy myself - my happiness isn’t
                    contingent on company. But maybe that’s because I so rarely find company that surprises me. That
                    reflects something familiar back at me. This week, though, I did. People who were warm, curious, and
                    quick to laugh. People who didn’t feel like strangers for long.
                    <br><br>
                    The last time I felt something like this was in Bilbao in 2022 - another unexpected bond formed with
                    Natalia and Emily. That friendship endured even after their graduation. Everyone else on that trip
                    spoke Polish, so most conversations drifted out of reach. It reminded me of my year in Stockholm too
                    - on the outside, just observing.
                    <br><br>
                    This week, I expected more of the same. That I’d be friendly but distant, quietly following my own
                    path. But I think the shift happened on Wednesday, after the alumni dinner. I wasn’t eating, so I
                    took a walk. At first, I planned not to return. But as I wandered, I realised something strange: I
                    wanted to go back. I wanted to sit with them, to talk, to be among them. That rarely happens. I
                    turned back, caught them at dessert, and slipped into the conversation like I hadn’t left.
                    <br><br>
                    Friendships are odd like that. Mine don’t tend to be about daily check-ins or constant contact. When
                    I reconnect with Nat and Em, there’s no awkwardness - just comfort. I’m beginning to think that’s
                    what matters. The quiet, mutual ease. The conversations that pick up where they left off, even if
                    they never really started properly.
                    <br><br>
                    Is it possible to feel that kind of tie with people you’ve only known for a few days?
                    <br><br>
                    I think it might be.
