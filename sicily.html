                <h2>Part Twenty Two - Planes, Trains & Automobiles</h2>
                <h5>Monday, 10th February <strong>18:30 GMT</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Back on home turf after six hours travelling. The flight was the longest and yet felt the shortest.
                    Orson Welles kept me occupied throughout. The bus driver taking me to Mile End from Stansted
                    clearly loathed his position. Very irascible, it didn’t take much for him to make it known that he
                    was only the bus driver and not the tour guide for visiting tourists.
                    <br><br>
                    There were a few Italians with me on the bus who I recognised from the train. The communication
                    barrier proved to be an issue when it came to tickets, but rather than attempt a universal gesture
                    or the time-honoured art of pointing, the driver opted for the classic British approach—repeating
                    the same sentence at an increasingly deafening volume, as if English miraculously becomes
                    comprehensible when shouted.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, back in Palermo, Silvio will be welcoming his next batch of guests—three French girls
                    eager to explore Sicily in its entirety. They’ve chosen Palermo as their starting point, a logical
                    decision on paper, though the reality of beginning their dream holiday in a crumbling slum may
                    temper their enthusiasm. According to Silvio, the rest of Sicily is far more beautiful. I sincerely
                    hope, for their sake, that he’s right.
                    <br><br>
                    I do wonder how Silvio will adapt to their presence. Will he restrain his more egregious sexist
                    diatribes, or will he take this as an opportunity to really double down? My money’s on the latter.
                    I’ve had a hands-on week, putting in long hours sanding, varnishing, building furniture, and
                    installing shelves. When he asked what skills the girls could bring to the table, they proudly
                    announced: <em>“We can babysit and cook meals.”</em> I’m genuinely surprised he let them stay, given
                    their complete lack of relevant abilities. But, then again, that’s no longer my concern. I’m out. No
                    more risk of getting mugged the second I step outside.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, sat in my student accommodation, looking at the concrete jungle out of my window, I miss
                    not being in Palermo. Despite everything. I would still pick Palermo over Leicester. Not just
                    because of the weather, or the people. But because it’s got <em>character</em>. It was chaotic,
                    unpredictable, alive—a welcome break from the monotony.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, reality reasserts itself. Tomorrow, my next module begins. I have an internship interview in
                    the morning, Demon Magazine articles to write, FYP meetings with my supervisor, and Leicester Comedy
                    Festival shows to cover for Demon FM.
                    <br><br>
                    Four more months, then I can finally say goodbye to this city—a place that functions less like a
                    home and more like an incessant black hole of ennui.

                <h2>Part Twenty One - Reflections</h2>
                <h5>Monday, 10th February <strong>10:35 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Palmero airport security is lackadaisical at best. No staff yelling diatribes at us; reminding us
                    the that liquids are prohibited and electricals must be visible. No staff of any kind in fact. Even
                    when we’re going through the metal detectors; there are adjoining rooms between each x-ray
                    presumably filled with SWAT in case were smuggling more than a litre of water through. If this isn’t
                    the case, it’s because it’s a mafia airport and smuggling is so omnipresent, the staff have
                    collectively resigned - or are susceptible to venality or depravities.
                    <br><br>
                    Now it’s time to reflect on yet another workaway volunteering experience. Was it the week I was
                    expecting – FUCK NO. Would I go back and change it; also no! I was expecting to be hosted at a cosy
                    little villa on the periphery of Palermo. Maybe a little closer to the beach, a short train ride
                    away from the city centre. This expectation was almost correct. What I didn’t expect whilst staying
                    there was to be in the heart of mafia controlled territory, targeted to be mugged and staying with a
                    man who’s views on democracy are similar to those of <em>Karl Marx.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio… is <em>a character</em>, I guess if I had to sum him up in a sentence. He’s sixty year old
                    and though he's had a relatively successful life; something tells me it wasn’t without crossing
                    paths with the law a few times. Highlights: hosting an illegal hostel, leader of an anti-vax group
                    in Sicily, building his own residence on a vacant spot of land with only the permission of the
                    landowner and not the authorities… need I go on.
                    <br><br>
                    Many conversations with Silvio spiralled into impassioned tirades about the oppression the
                    proletariat must endure under the iron grip of government control. He’s a zealot—one whose
                    inferences rarely follow a logical trajectory, instead hurtling towards wild non sequiturs with
                    unshakable conviction. He is, in no uncertain terms, sexist, homophobic, implacable, parsimonious,
                    and utterly unrepentant. Steadfast in his beliefs, no matter how contrarian or inflammatory, he
                    clings to them with the fervour of a man who has never once considered he might be wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, despite—or perhaps because of—all this, my week with Silvio has been one of the most
                    fascinating of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    I was ostensibly a guest in order to help Silvio with his woodworking portfolio, restoring
                    furniture, hanging shelves, building units for the guest house. Capable work for an artisan like
                    myself. Silvio was amenable for what hours and days I worked; allowing me to make the most of the
                    days in the sun.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of the prosaic surroundings of Tommaso Natale, getting the train into Palermo became the
                    status quo. Beating the system and avoiding the ticket officers, I fully embraced the criminal
                    pedigree one requires to live in Sicily.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, the citadel. I was picturing <em>The White Lotus.</em> Instead I got <em>Goodfellas</em> and
                    <em>Heretic</em>. On the walking tour, it was explained that <em>The White Lotus</em> wasn’t even
                    filmed here. Blasphemy! <em>Godfather Part III</em>, however was filmed on the stairs of the Palermo
                    Opera House. Many years ago, Al Pacino was shot on those very stairs.
                    <br><br>
                    On each visit to the capital of Sicily, I walked a different direction, accumulating over fifty
                    miles. Not all districts were of the idyllic quality that I was expecting but that is a given for
                    every city in the world.
                    <br><br>
                    It's hard to comprehend the amount of revelations that have happened this week.
                    <br><br>
                    At times, it felt like I was wandering through the slums of Yemen, no laws, no respect. I’ve been in
                    witness to a traffic collision, walked straight through Mafia territory brandishing my camera for
                    all to see, got targeted for a mugging, had a car accident, spent week cohabiting with a conspiracy
                    theorist, helped build a church for conversion therapy, showered in sewer water and had more
                    conversations in Spanish than in Italian.
                    <br><br>
                    And yet, I’ve had some of the best meals of my life. Palermo’s chaotic, unfiltered, and bizarrely
                    captivating in its own crumbling grandeur and if I’ve learnt anything in this eventful week, it’s
                    never trust a pretty girl with sticky fingers.

                <h2>Part Twenty - Looney Tune Repairs</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 9th February <strong>22:20 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    The relentless downpour has us effectively under house arrest. With nowhere to go and nothing to do,
                    I resign myself to the dubious pleasure of watching Silvio engage in his peculiar brand of DIY.
                    There are odd jobs to be done, and though he’s happy to tackle them alone, he occasionally summons
                    me when an extra pair of hands is required.
                    <br><br>
                    First, he’s welding a wooden foot back onto the underside of the couch. I ask, more out of morbid
                    curiosity than genuine interest, “Why are you welding it?” His response is as baffling as it is
                    final: “The glue isn’t strong enough.” I stare at him, then at the wooden leg, which is already
                    beginning to bow under the heat. It’s wood, it’ll just snap. But I’m out of here tomorrow, so
                    frankly, it’s not my problem. I retreat to my room to block him out, but the flickering lights make
                    that impossible.
                    <br><br>
                    Stepping back into the living room, I find that he’s wired up his welder using an extension cord
                    with exposed wiring—just loose, frayed copper strands sitting there, waiting for someone (likely me)
                    to step on them and be electrocuted. Carefully stepping over the trap, I go to get some water. When
                    I turn back round, Silvio is sprawled on the floor, a screwdriver jammed into an electrical socket.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t ask. I don’t want to know. Every instinct in my body screams to tell him to turn off the
                    power before plunging metal objects into live outlets, but I know better by now. Health and safety
                    is, after all, a British concept, and Silvio operates on an entirely different wavelength. <em>“The
                    World’s not a dangerous place Harry”.</em> I’ll escribe it onto his tombstone.
                    <br><br>
                    Half time of the Villa vs Spurs game, he’s perched atop a ladder, half naked. Top half thankfully,
                    didn’t want to see his <em>Italian Pride</em> on my last night in Sicily. This trip’s been memorable
                    enough. He's precariously balanced on the kitchen table. Apparently, one of the bulbs isn’t bright
                    enough, though I suspect it’s not the light that’s not bright. I watch him teeter for a moment,
                    bracing for the inevitable crash, but decide I don’t want to be privy to whatever impending disaster
                    is about to unfold. I return to my room, feigning ignorance.
                    <br><br>
                    I wish he did enlighten me to his itinerary because we could have got the job done – correctly.
                    There’s the right way of doing things and then Silvio’s way of doing things. Every task he
                    completes, normally generate three more.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s like watching someone attempt DIY based solely on Looney Tunes logic. Frankly, it’s a miracle
                    he’s managed to construct this bungalow at all. Apart from the dubious wiring, malfunctioning
                    plumbing, erratic heating, blocked sewage pipes and door locks that are completely arbitrary, it’s a
                    canny little place.
                    <br><br>
                    Chicken & roast potatoes for tea tonight. We talked about family and relationships. He gushed over
                    his daughter; Silvia – daughter of Silvio. Couldn’t get much more Sicilian if they tried. He had
                    nothing but good words to say about her. Unfortunately, given his sexist proclivities, the good
                    epithets he used were similar to those that Donald Trump would use. <em>“Very good facial features,
                    and lumpy breasted.”</em> Lumpy breasted? That’s a sign of cancer is it not?
                    <br><br>
                    I make my excuses using the pretence that I must pack, which isn’t technically a lie. Even so, I’m
                    ready to leave. One more night then I’m back on home turf, where I don’t have a target on my back or
                    the Mafia lurking in the shadows.

                <h2>Part Nineteen - More People Die in Car Accidents than Mafia Shootings</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 9th February <strong>14:39 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Palermo's only a twenty-minute drive, but I have never been so hyper-aware of my surroundings.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s like the hazard perception test on steroids. Pedestrians meander into the middle of the road
                    with total disregard for oncoming traffic, cars lurch out of junctions without warning, and mopeds
                    zip between lanes like they have a death wish. Pure, unfiltered chaos.
                    <br><br>
                    To make matters worse, Silvio’s clapped-out shitbox is barely holding itself together. I never truly
                    understood what the Top Gear lads meant when they said they’d “lost third gear” until now. Except in
                    my case, I’d lost second, fourth, and fifth. Where they went, I have no idea, but I was left revving
                    the hell out of first gear before catapulting straight into third. Maybe that’s why nobody here
                    stops for anything—because they’ve only got two functioning gears to work with.
                    <br><br>
                    By some miracle, I make it to Palermo in one piece.
                    <br><br>
                    Parking is not an issue at all. We can park anywhere – literally. Double stacking, sure. Pull up on
                    the pavement, that’s fine. I have seen one driver park up at a traffic light and then just walk off.
                    So, I followed suit, blocking someone in an alleyway. Hopefully, I don’t come back and the car’s
                    been stolen or clamped; or bricked.
                    <br><br>
                    The walking tour didn’t disappoint though I had visited all the stops along the route sometime over
                    the past week. Knowing a little history of the place is always a nice addition to any trip. This
                    tour covered everything from the municipal buildings, the history of Sicilian monarchy to the Mafia
                    and tourist stereotypes.
                    <br><br>
                    One every walking tour I’ve attended, there are always the same personality types drawn to them.
                    <br><br>
                    First, there’s the wannabe-teacher—usually a middle-aged man, exuding the energy of someone who once
                    taught history at a secondary school and never quite got over it. He interrupts the guide with
                    unnecessary corrections, obscure facts, and “actually” statements that no one asked for. The guide
                    mentions Italian fascist in the 40s? Well, Wannabe-Teacher read a book on the subject once, and now
                    we all have to hear about it.
                    <br><br>
                    We have the Instagram Couple always lagging behind, trying to get the perfect shot while the guide
                    explains something important. The guy’s in charge of angles, the girl’s adjusting her hair every
                    five seconds, and at half the tour is spent waiting for them to catch up. Bonus points if one of
                    them is wearing a ridiculously impractical outfit, like stilettos on cobblestone streets like the
                    girl in Vienna.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there’s the silent lurker. This one’s a mystery. No questions, no reactions, just a faint nod
                    every now and then. Is he enjoying himself? Who knows. Is he secretly a journalist researching an
                    exposé on walking tours? Possibly. He’s either absorbing every word with monk-like intensity or
                    mentally composing a list of ways this could all be more efficient. Either way, he’ll disappear
                    immediately after the tour ends without so much as a goodbye.
                    <br><br>
                    There’s always a lost tourist who invariably makes their way onto the tour. They look perpetually
                    confused, checking their phone for where they actually meant to be while politely pretending to care
                    about 17th-century architecture. Just following the crowd, hoping we return to the metropolitan part
                    of the city. In Copenhagen, a woman joined us just as the tour was ending and resulted in giving a
                    tip after been cornered by the tour guide.
                    <br><br>
                    And lastly, there’s me; half in it for the history, half just looking for an excuse to walk to make
                    sure I cover all the tourist attractions. Occasionally, I’ll ask a question to prove I’m engaged,
                    but really, I’m just here for the photographs.
                    <br><br>
                    I still have half a day’s work to do so I’m driving back to Tommaso Natale around 2ish. Weaving
                    through the traffic, the inevitable happens—someone rear-ends me. Technically, it’s my fault but it
                    wouldn’t be if we were in England. I stopped at a zebra crossing to let people cross but of course
                    this isn’t the normal thing to do here. The car behind doesn’t stop, hitting me. The guy pulls up
                    next to me and probably delivers a polemic in Italian and then drives off. No details exchanges,
                    insurance policies dug out the glove compartment. Off we go.
                    <br><br>
                    Now comes the real dilemma: do I tell Silvio? Considering he wasn’t remotely bothered about our
                    scrape the other day; I’m deciding to embrace his laissez-faire attitude and keep it to myself. I’ll
                    be gone this time tomorrow so I just need to hold my nerve till them.

                <h5>Sunday, 9th February <strong>08:15 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Since I’m persona non grata in Tommaso Natale without the risk of being robbed and I can’t sit
                    around indulging Silvio with his conspiracy theories, I’m heading into Palermo for my last outing –
                    probably ever. Not because I’m going to get murdered but because once I leave Sicily, I don’t see a
                    reason to return.
                    <br><br>
                    Every time I arrived at a new destination, I oblige in my normal routine of booking a walking tour.
                    This morning is the first day where I’ve been awake early enough to be in Palermo by 10am. Taking
                    Sally’s warning seriously, I asked Silvio for a lift to the station and received the expected apathy
                    followed by dismissal.
                    <br><br>
                    Because he still wants to be accommodating (and because I get to rate him upon the conclusion of my
                    trip) but not an accessory to hysteria, he tells me to take his car and just drive to Palermo. I’m
                    so excited. Hopefully, I don’t collide with any fences - or cyclists. Though, if you could see the
                    condition of the battered Yaris, one more dent wouldn’t make a difference.

                <h2>Part Seventeen - Embracing Fate</h2>
                <h5>Saturday, 8th February <strong>19:20 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Desperate for an escape, I fled back to Palermo. Anything to avoid being held captive by Silvio’s
                    latest conspiracy. His brand of paranoia is exhausting, an endless monologue of half-baked theories
                    that threaten to erode my sanity. Sally gave me a lift on his way home, taking the opportunity to
                    hammer his point once more: <em>take this seriously.</em> Ignore Silvio’s laissez-faire attitude—his
                    detachment isn’t wisdom, it’s just his modus operandi. (Just the way he is).
                    <br><br>
                    Part of me still suspects this is all theatrical fanfare, an elaborate ghost story for the unwitting
                    tourist. Until I see a mafia-sanctioned abduction in broad daylight, or a restaurant engulfed in
                    flames, I’ll remain cautiously incredulous.
                    <br><br>
                    At least Palermo offered another fascinating excursion. I stuck to the northeast, weaving through
                    the docks where the city meets the sea. The sun was warm, the salty breeze carried the scent of fish
                    and diesel, and boats bobbed lazily among the waves. For a moment, Palermo felt almost serene—until
                    the screech of brakes shattered the illusion. A rickshaw on its side, wheels still spinning in the
                    air. An elderly couple standing dazed nearby. I didn’t linger; the growing crowd blocked any view of
                    the aftermath. I’m honestly surprised, I’ve not seen more accidents in this past week.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, I’ve grown accustomed to crossing these streets, though it’s still unnerving to have to
                    walk into traffic and pray that drivers will, at the very least, hesitate. A stark reminder to
                    remain aware of their eyelines—if they don’t see you, you don’t exist.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long afternoon wandering through Palermo’s tangled streets and devouring another few
                    chapters of Welles’ absurdly cinematic life, I’m back on the train. I text Sally to collect me from
                    Cardillo station. Silvio, predictably, thinks we’re being hysterical—that I’m just another
                    subservient cog in the great machine of fear, manipulated by big organisations and their reign of
                    terror.
                    <br><br>
                    Since it’s likely my last outing to the city since I’ve got one day of work left; I’ll miss visiting
                    one quarter of it. There’s a rawness to it, something both grand and dilapidated, beautiful in its
                    own imperfect way. I’m still trying to find the picture-perfect holiday destination that I see
                    depicted on TV.

                <h2>Part Sixteen - Disconcerted? A Little</h2>
                <h5>Saturday, 8th February <strong>13:35 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    We continued our efforts in restoring the furniture that’s building up in the church. I’m doing the
                    menial jobs such as sanding and varnishing. Repeating the same continuous motion becomes relaxing
                    after a while. Almost tranquil and peaceful. Then it had to start raining so the second half of my
                    work detail continued indoors. I’ve been reorganising Silvio’s Shakespeare folios into comedies,
                    tragedies and histories. They’re in Italian but I can deduce which play is which by the title and
                    picture on the front.
                    <br><br>
                    Bet you didn’t know that Shakespeare was merely a public figurehead, while his secret
                    lover—conveniently erased from history—was the <em>true</em> genius behind the plays. At least,
                    that’s the latest gem Silvio has decided to enlighten me with. Now, it’s hardly scandalous to
                    suggest that Shakespeare may have been gay, but to reduce him to some illiterate puppet, a glorified
                    Elizabethan influencer? The sheer ignominy of it! My innate British heritage is screaming; I think
                    I’ve given myself an ulcer from biting my tongue so frequently. How <em>dare</em> he disparage the
                    Bard with such unqualified drivel?
                    <br><br>
                    Sally walks in, interrupting Silvio’s conspiracy lessons, desperation in his voice.
                    <br><br>
                    He explains, <em>“I’ve been seen”.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    A newcomer in the neighbourhood, carrying an expensive-looking camera—an unmistakable red flag. I
                    suppose it was that two-and-a-half hour walk from Tommaso Natale to Palermo centre that put me on
                    the radar. Walking through every neighbourhood, snapping away. I guess that was asinine given the
                    dodgy areas I was wandering through.
                    <br><br>
                    So, in no uncertain terms, I’m ordered not to leave the compound; get Silvio to drive me to the
                    station and text whenever I return so that either he or Sally can collect me. And if I dare to
                    wander around Tommaso Natale, I must ensure it’s glaringly obvious that I’m not carrying a backpack.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio, of course, waves off the warning with his usual insouciance. The world isn’t dangerous,
                    remember? Perhaps to him, with his boundless optimism and questionable past, but I’ve always been
                    one to err on the side of caution. Do I believe Sally’s concerns? I’m unsure. Part of me thinks it’s
                    all performative theatrics, a melodrama put on for the benefit of an impressionable outsider. Yet,
                    another part—one that leans towards self-preservation—knows better than to dismiss the unease
                    outright.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe I need something concrete, a sign that I’m truly in the crosshairs. A Memento Mori delivered
                    to my doorstep, a Sicilian calling card that screams: <em>You should have listened.</em>

                <h2>Part Fifteen - The Man Beneath the Façade</h2>
                <h5>Friday, 7th February <strong>22:11 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Silvio is NUTS. Like, genuinely, certifiably nuts. I had my suspicions early on, little clues
                    dropped in past conversations, but it’s taken me a while to fully piece together just how deep this
                    madness runs. He’s like Dominic, but with a more unhinged collection of conspiracy theories rattling
                    around in his brain.
                    <br><br>
                    Before COVID, he was a music teacher. That is, until he refused to get the vaccine, putting both
                    students and staff at risk. Not content with just being a personal health hazard, he took it upon
                    himself to start proselytising, urging others to resist the jab as well. Naturally, he got sacked.
                    Rather than accept that actions have consequences, he doubled down, convinced that he was the last
                    bastion of truth in a world brainwashed by “Big Pharma” and government control.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, his response was to open his home to complete strangers, all to prove that the world
                    isn’t a big and scary place. I, for one, completely disagree. The world <em>is</em> a big and scary
                    place, and people like Silvio are a prime example of why. I’m not saying don’t explore; I’m saying
                    remain vigilant and assess potential risks. But, of course, arguing with him would be like reasoning
                    with a lunatic, so I nod along and let him ramble.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there’s his newfound adoration for Communism, which, hilariously, seems to have stemmed from a
                    single Workaway volunteer from Poland. This guy lived under Communist rule and, apparently, now
                    makes less money in a democratic society than he did under an authoritarian regime. Instead of
                    recognising that as anecdotal at best, Silvio has taken this as indisputable proof that communism is
                    the superior way of life. Never mind the historical evidence, the oppression, or the fact that
                    people literally risked their lives escaping it—no, one broke Polish bloke is all the confirmation
                    Silvio needs.
                    <br><br>
                    And then we get to the real kicker: his entire living situation is dodgy as hell. He built this
                    house from the ground up not out of some noble, off-the-grid, self-sufficient dream, but because he
                    was banned from owning property after running an illegal hostel at his previous residence. Again,
                    this isn’t speculation—this is coming directly from him, said with the casual air of someone
                    discussing the weather. He wasn’t confessing, he was bragging.
                    <br><br>
                    But the cherry on top? The church. The derelict church he’s so lovingly restoring isn’t just some
                    quaint pet project or an attempt to give back to the community. No, no, no. He’s renovating it
                    because his son is gay, and he genuinely believes this will somehow “bring him back to the light.” I
                    mean, is it just a church, or is Silvio planning something more grandiose, some twisted little
                    conversion therapy cult under the guise of religious salvation? At this point, I wouldn’t put
                    anything past him.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s actually mental. The more I learn, the more I’m grateful I’m only here for the week instead of
                    a month.

                <h2>Part Fourteen - Palmero = Done ✅</h2>
                <h5>Friday, 7th February <strong>19:02 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Silvio and I decided to take another day off since the weather was perfect. After he prepared me yet
                    another sublime sandwich, I set off for Palermo for the fifth day in a row. But today was
                    different—I walked the entire way. Two and a half hours, passing every station along the train line.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I reached the city centre, I didn’t stop there. I continued south, hugging the coastline,
                    hoping to stumble upon some natural beauty—golden sands, crystal-clear waters, something to redeem
                    Palermo’s rugged exterior. But as I walked further, it became clear that if I kept going in search
                    of paradise, I might as well circumnavigate the entire island. Eventually, I turned back, accepting
                    that Palermo is not quite the grand holiday destination I had imagined. I spent the rest of the
                    afternoon reading Orson Welles’ biography in the park.
                    <br><br>
                    After five days of exploring and covering nearly nine miles a day, I feel I know this city like the
                    back of my hand. Each quarter has its own distinct character. The northeast is picturesque,
                    tourist-friendly, and home to the harbour. The northwest blends verdant parks and grand cathedrals
                    with creeping signs of poverty. The southeast is a grittier stretch—mainly an exit road flanked by a
                    bleak, debris-strewn coastline. The southwest, meanwhile, could easily be mistaken for a slum in the
                    Middle East.
                    <br><br>
                    Still, I’ve seen it all.

                <h2>Part Thirteen - Screams, Scams and Skinny Jeans</h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>23:15 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    My first real-world experience with the perfidy of the Sicilians happened tonight. I’d heard the
                    stories about the Mafia and witnessed firsthand the poor conditions they impose on the capital, but
                    a part of me still found it hard to believe the veracity of the tales I’d been told.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me start from the beginning. After a very filling tea consisting of - you guessed it, dough,
                    potatoes and ham in a new combination - Sally and I drove to pub around fifteen minutes away from
                    Silvio’s place to watch the football. He’s still slightly depressed after his beloved Arsenal were
                    humiliated last night. He wanted to see Spurs receive the same treatment but that didn’t come to
                    fruition.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned, he is Sri Lankan but has lived here in Sicily for over a decade working as a handyman.
                    He came over on a cricket scholarship and never left, very much suiting the congruous criminality of
                    Tommaso Natale.
                    <br><br>
                    The pub wasn’t in Palermo but in a place called Vespi. It’s authentically Sicilian. Tourists don’t
                    come this far out of the city - <em>for safety reasons.</em> Everyone’s drinking scotch, smoking
                    cigars. I can’t even see the ceiling because of the thick layer of smoke. We were at the bar
                    enjoying the game, staying out of trouble, until half time at least.
                    <br><br>
                    Then we hear a scream from outside. The only reason I mention it is because of the slightly obscure
                    reaction of everyone in the bar. The reaction was no reaction. It sounded different from a girl just
                    falling over. To me, it sounded more like a shriek of pain but I am just speculating.
                    <br><br>
                    I instinctively get off my bar stool to go look at the commotion, but my arm’s seized by Sally who
                    hasn’t moved. I’m trying to remember but I don’t think anyone was too perturbed by the scream. It
                    was definitely loud enough that everyone could hear. I get back on my stool and ask Sally what’s
                    going on. He’s swirling his scotch around the glass and seems to be lost in a reverie.
                    <br><br>
                    The game finishes and Sally’s chatting to friends at the bar. This is one of the only sports bars
                    outside of Palermo that’s not Mafia controlled - <em>apparently</em> – which is why we’re here. I’m
                    still not entirely sure what that actually means. Are Mafia bars like fronts for laundering money?
                    Are they storing stolen goods? Or just skimming a cut of the profits under the guise of “protection”
                    fees? Of course, all my conclusions are based on <em>A Bronx Tale, Goodfellas, </em>and <em>Donnie
                    Brasco</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m waiting for Sally outside for a few minutes. It’s a convivial atmosphere. It’s a young crowd. My
                    sort of age. Out of nowhere, an Italian bird comes up to me and starts a conversation. I don’t speak
                    Italian, and she doesn’t speak English, <em>though I do speak a little Spanish. Va va vroom.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    With me being a cheeky-chappie, and my “everyone loves an Englishman” attitude, we’re fumbling
                    through this conversation. Her attempts to bridge the language barrier with her gestures and eager
                    smiles are more endearing than effective, but we’re getting somewhere.
                    <br><br>
                    She’s clearly growing impatient, though. With a flirtatious twirl of her hand, she leans in closer.
                    Before I even have time to register what’s happening, she swings both arms around me and is kissing
                    me. At first, I’m caught off guard, thinking this is just the Italian way—passionate, spontaneous, a
                    trademark of Sicilian culture. It’s all part of the dance, right? The grand romantic gesture, the
                    universal language of love that everyone talks about when describing the Italian spirit.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as I’m patting my ego on the back - her hands move lower. I feel a sudden, unexpected tug at
                    the pocket of my jeans. The subtle motion is so fluid, it could have been mistaken for just another
                    affectionate touch—if I hadn’t felt the unmistakable shift in weight as she tried to lift my phone
                    from my pocket.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>I’m being robbed.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    It was an odd feeling. For a second, I’m frozen. My brain is registering what’s happening, but my
                    body lags behind, unsure. As soon as I felt significant weight shift, I think instinct kicked in.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank God for my skinny jeans. I’ve never been so grateful for tight pockets in my life. With a
                    quick movement, I catch my phone, her supple fingers let go and I’m just looking her directly in the
                    eyes.
                    <br><br>
                    This creeped me out. I’ve never seen anyone’s eyes change so vehemently before. Especially someone
                    with such beautiful baby blues… She went from <em>Holly Golightly</em> to <em>Baby Jane</em> real
                    fast. And we all know how terrified I am of the latter.
                    <br><br>
                    Before anything is said, Sally’s once again grabbing me by the arm leading me toward the car. Now I
                    get it. The romance, the flirting? All part of the game. It’s not my charm she’s interested in—just
                    what’s in my trousers. My phone, I mean. My phone.
                    <br><br>
                    I was experiencing a bit of a head rush as we were driving off. I semi-knew what happened but I was
                    still fuzzy. In the car, Sally’s letting me in on the street scams. <em>“They work in teams,”</em>
                    he said, <em>“and if they know you’ve got expensive gear, they’ll target you again.”</em> Well,
                    great to know, and here I thought she was just entranced by my English charm. I’ll have to remember
                    this scam for when the Parisian lucky lucky men come my way.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m still confused about the scream though. He didn’t answer that question, but I doubt it’s as
                    sinister as what we’re all thinking. Sicily may not be as progressive as I had thought but it’s not
                    ran by gangsters and the Mafia in the way that the movies will have us believe. Or am I still being
                    incredibly naïve?

                <h2>Part Twelve - Palermo at My Own Pace</h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>18:50 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    My first day off, and after my little tribulation last night, I <em>needed</em> it. The sun was out,
                    the tasks weren’t urgent, and Silvio let me have the full day to myself—on the condition that I’d
                    work one day over the weekend. No complaints from me, since the weather’s set to turn miserable by
                    Saturday night anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    So, back to Palermo. I tried to catch a walking tour at 11 AM, only to find they don’t exist. Just
                    the 10 AM ones, which was annoying. But since I’ve already combed through this city—top to bottom,
                    east to west, seeing both the picturesque and the profane, the sublime among the malign—today was a
                    much more relaxed affair. Stuck to the high street, indulged in a little window shopping, sat down
                    in every park I passed, and gave my feet the break they desperately deserved.
                    <br><br>
                    For lunch, Silvio had made me a sandwich. Not very Italian I know, but regardless, it was one of the
                    most delicious sandwiches I’ve ever had in my life. It puts my turkey and cheese ensemble to shame.
                    It was the size of a small pancake, filled with fried chicken, lettuce, mozzarella, mayonnaise,
                    zucchini, aubergine, a rare herb found only in the Himalayas, the blood of a mountain goat, the
                    vestiges of the grain forged in the heart of Mount Vesuvius. You get the picture.
                    <br><br>
                    After finishing one fiction yesterday, I started the Orson Welles biography right in front of the
                    Norman Palace. From the first few chapters, he sounds like a relative of Jay Gatsby, interacting
                    with artists, artisans, poets, impresarios, screenwriters, authors, and even Moroccan royalty, all
                    before the youthful crescent of 20! He is unequivocally a gifted child, processing the elocution of
                    a actor much older, becoming a Shakespeare afficionado at twelve, writing his first screenplay at
                    sixteen, Broadway at seventeen. You read about people like this and it’s almost they are destined
                    for greatness.
                    <br><br>
                    One little blunder this afternoon—the public toilets. First off, they’re gender-neutral. How modern.
                    A neat row of cubicles, surprisingly clean, none of the nightmarish filth you brace yourself for
                    when thinking of public loos. My mistake? I thought they were free.
                    <br><br>
                    I go to unlock the door. It doesn’t budge. No problem, probably just jammed. I give it a nudge.
                    Nothing. So, naturally, I resort to shouldering it a few times. It moves slightly, but not enough.
                    One final push—I put my foot through it. Snap. Lock broken. <em>Bit stiff, that,</em> I thought. Of
                    course, it wasn’t stuck. It was locked. Because, as I discovered moments later, Palermo operates on
                    a <em>pay-to-pee</em> system.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Bloody Mafia, taxing us for everything…</em>
                    <br><br>
                    I clock my faux pas as I leave and finally spot the euro signs on the door. Good thing there aren’t
                    cameras in there, or I might be expecting a visit from <em>Tommy-Two-Fingers &
                    Jimmy-the-snitch.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Caught the train back to Cardillo just as the first droplets are starting to fall. If I board five
                    minutes before departure, I can usually circumvent the ticket inspectors. The fare’s only €2, but
                    for all I know, the trains are Mafia-run too. And honestly, I don’t need to add <em>another</em>
                    moral failing to my growing list of peccadillos.

                <h2>Part Eleven - Hallucinogens in the Pasta? </h2>
                <h5>Thursday, 6th February <strong>08:53 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I woke up in the middle of the night completely disoriented. No idea if I had a momentary sleepwalk
                    or I rolled the wrong way out of bed, but when I finally came to, I was in the middle of my room,
                    wrapped in my duvet, cowering in a heap on the cold stone floor.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, my room doesn’t have any windows. No charging lights. No alarm clock glow. Just thick,
                    suffocating darkness. I tried fumbling for something—anything—to ground myself, but it was
                    pointless. Sat there waiting for my eyes to adjust, but as I’d already discovered on my first
                    morning here, there needs to be a light source for that to happen. No light source, no vision. Which
                    is why, at 10:30 AM, this room is still black as the void.
                    <br><br>
                    So I stand up trying to get my balance but the stone floor is freezing my feet. Taking my
                    queen-sized duvet, I’m trying to shuffle to something I can latch onto. I don’t want to be dramatic
                    here, but I do remember my sleep depraved mind thinking <em>what if I’ve gone blind – that’s why I
                    can’t see.</em> I don’t know how long standing, trying to understand what was happening. That’s when
                    I heard a object drop onto the stone slabs.
                    <br><br>
                    I drop to my knees, patting the floor trying to find the object; exactly how Velma looked when she
                    dropped her glasses in <em>Scooby-Doo</em>. I found it, it was my laptop mouse. My saving grace in
                    my time of need. The LED light on the underside, the signal guiding me out of my blind purgatory.
                    Clicking the button so the light flashes, it guided me the two feet or so back to my bed. Now, I
                    know this makes me sound completely and utterly retarded, or a dunce, but believe me, it was the
                    most terrified I’ve been in a while thinking I must have gone blind.
                    <br><br>
                    As you can imagine, it took me a while to get back off to sleep after that little charade.

                <h2>Part Ten - Tea Time </h2>
                <h5>Wednesday, 5th February <strong>21:20 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Another <em>riveting</em> dinner table conversation with Silvio this evening. Somehow, we (or rather
                    he) ended up on the topic of gender and sexuality. Latest revelation: he’s a right-wing libertarian.
                    Oh, and homophobic. Loves the idea of living off the land, free from government interference. Which,
                    in hindsight, makes total sense—he built this entire bungalow himself. Something tells me there
                    wasn’t much in the way of planning permission involved, but that’s hardly my problem. Very strong
                    opinions on same-sex marriage. Found myself nodding obsequiously just to stop myself being kicked
                    out onto the streets.
                    <br><br>
                    The real kicker, though, was his deep dive into what is and isn’t controlled. According to him,
                    every restaurant, every independent supermarket, every souvenir shop in Palermo—<em>all</em> of them
                    answer to someone. Turns out, the reason he’s such a dedicated chef isn’t just a love for cooking.
                    He refuses to give a cent to the local supermarkets because, you guessed it, they’re mob-controlled.
                    Even the tacky little souvenir shops? Yep. I’ve unknowingly contributed to <em>the cause</em>. My €1
                    magnet is now a permanent stain on my conscience.
                    <br><br>
                    Food-wise, tonight was a first—pasta. The trademark of Sicilian gastronomy: Macaroni drowned in
                    cheese with meat, peas, and aubergines. Every single ingredient, on its own? Great. But somehow, the
                    combination was <em>deeply</em> unsettling. It tasted like… sick. Weird huh. Obviously, I kept that
                    little critique to myself. Silvio did, however, comment on my portion sizes—apparently, I eat less
                    than any of his previous fourteen guests.
                    <br><br>
                    The routine is simple: at 2 PM, after work, he makes me something—spaghetti, an omelette, or some
                    variation of dough, ham, and cheese. Then I spend my afternoon in Palermo, and by the time I get
                    back at 8 PM, there’s a massive portion of a traditional meal waiting. It’s always still in the pan,
                    ready to be dished up at will. The problem? I’m still full from whatever he made me earlier. And
                    yet, somehow, I still manage to walk away feeling guilty for not eating more.

                <p>
                    Since my hamstrings were aching and my feet cramping up, I didn’t do my marathon long walk around
                    Palermo today. After the disappointing display yesterday, I wanted to stick to the more touristy
                    parts. Plus, today was the first day of sun we’ve had that haven’t been accompanied with clouds, so
                    I didn’t need to do any fancy camera trickery to make my pictures look brighter than it actually
                    was. I stuck by the harbour and settled down to read my book. Nice and relaxing after my onerous
                    morning. I spoke to some of the locals in shops and got my customary magnet. Oddly, I’ve had more
                    conversations in Spanish in Sicily than Italian. I’ve found communicating with locals is easier in
                    Spanish as the Italian equivalent is a closer resemblance than English.
                    <br><br>
                    A calming day despite the hectic start.

                <h2>Part Eight - Scrapes & Bruises</h2>
                <h5>Wednesday, 5th February <strong>14:05 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I got into a car accident this morning. Well, I say accident… Let me clear a few things up. First of
                    all, I wasn’t driving this time which is a nice change in these situations. No one was hurt, just a
                    bit of cosmetic damage to cars that are little more than scrap value anyway. Now, it was hardly
                    surprising that I witnessed one eventually, because the driving I’ve witnessed is mind-boggling.
                    There are road markings, but they are completely disregarded. In the UK, the responsibility is on
                    the driver at the junction to pull out when safe to do so. Slightly different philosophy here;
                    junctions are futile, and cars don’t stop. The onus is on the driver already speeding at 50kph to
                    either slam on the brakes or embrace their fate. Apparently, playing bumper cars isn’t just the
                    accepted status quo—it’s not even considered a transgression.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio proved this firsthand when he pulled straight onto a roundabout and we got clipped. He didn’t
                    even bother exchanging details with the other driver. <em>“These things happen Harry”.</em> Do they?
                    Because where I’m from, this is what insurance fraud is made of. I had a hint of Silvio’s driving
                    going to Montello beach, zigzagging, driving in the middle of the road, going through red lights,
                    etc. I thought Italy was more evolved than this.
                    <br><br>
                    The second half of my workday took a nostalgic turn—right back to my ten-year-old self. Climbing
                    trees and falling out of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I was picking oranges, and since the best ones were at the top, I did what any self-respecting
                    monkey would do: scaled the tree. Agile. Efficient. Until my hamstrings decided otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    After days of walking five miles in flat, unsupportive shoes, my feet chose this exact moment to
                    cramp up. Yelping, I took the express route down—flat on my back. The only witness to my
                    humiliation? Chico, the ever-loyal dog, who bolted over and covered me in concerned, slobbery
                    reassurance.
                    <br><br>
                    At least someone cared.

                    I set my alarm this morning, so I didn’t take the same liberties as yesterday. Though this wasn’t
                    needed because my wall borders the main road, and the council started digging it up to fix the
                    sewage line to the property at seven. Still, I didn’t surface until well after nine.
                    <br><br>
                    I was in the shower when I heard the side door squeak and Silvio shout something through to me. Over
                    the noise of the water, I only caught fragments: <em>“Harry, don’t use … … it’s connected to the
                    sewer.”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Have I just washed my hair in sewage water? I’d rather not think about it. I used shampoo, so I’m
                    banking on that being an effective barrier against whatever bacteria was swirling around in there.
                    That’s how shampoo works, right?
                    <br><br>
                    The morning’s work was different from yesterday. We were in the church around the side of the
                    property, restoring furniture and parts of the altar. The construction is still in its early stages,
                    so today was mostly sanding. I met Sally, a Sri Lankan handyman hired to maintain the property. And
                    in case there’s any confusion—Sally is a bloke, with a heart of gold and an <em>adorable</em> dog
                    called Chico. He gave me some solid recommendations on places to check out in Palermo and, more
                    importantly, places to avoid.
                    <br><br>
                    So, naturally, in true adventurer fashion, I ignored his advice entirely.
                    <br><br>
                    When I got to Palermo, I headed west—away from the tourist hubs, away from the postcard version of
                    the city. Big mistake. Three hours of wandering, and what did I see? Bike thieves swiping two phones
                    in broad daylight, a dead dog rotting by the side of the road, kids who couldn’t have been older
                    than twelve smoking weed, and street vendors casually doing a line of something <em>definitely</em>
                    not legal. This was Sicily without the filter. The kind you don’t find in the brochures.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve never wanted to get back to civilised society so badly. I didn’t dare get my camera out for
                    fear of it getting taxed…
                    <br><br>
                    I returned to Silvio’s place disconsolate. This isn’t what I had in mind when I wanted to spend the
                    week in Sicily. To make up for this failed expedition, Silvio had an authentic spaghetti recipe
                    waiting for me. It wasn’t in a bolognaise but just in a sauce that was delicious. When I asked for
                    it, you would have thought that I had just harvested his Abuela for organs. <em>“No, no, no, Harry.
                    Not something I can do!”</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Family recipes in Sicily aren’t just food; they’re legacy. To be enjoyed, never altered, and
                    certainly never shared. Lesson learned.
                    <br><br>
                    Slight digression back to the civilised world of Leicester. As I’m writing this, I’m also in contact
                    with the writers, sorting out the next edition of Demon Magazine. And I’m absolutely howling. Why?
                    Because I’ve just thrown two lads under the bus, pissed off all the women in the group chat with a
                    hilarious (but apparently sexist) gif, and now I’m being threatened with being reported to the
                    student union. (For context, the student union is run by one guy called Dave—quite possibly the most
                    laid-back man alive. The fact that he has full control over every society at the university while
                    maintaining such extreme levels of nonchalance is, frankly, mind-blowing.)
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, let me explain—once I’ve stopped giggling.
                    <br><br>
                    So, these two lads both wanted to do a Champions League roundup for the issue. I chimed in with,
                    <em>“If one of you wants to do an article explaining the new CL format, that would be fucking
                        helpful 🤣.”</em> Jess—our ever-efficient editor—promptly assigned both their names to the
                    spreadsheet, effectively sealing their fate. After a bit of back and forth in the chat, they
                    begrudgingly decided who was writing what. That should’ve been the end of it.
                    <br><br>
                    But, of course, I couldn’t leave it there.
                    <br><br>
                    I suggested giving them <em>both</em> a double-page spread, because, well, I’m a nob. Jess, again,
                    ratified it without hesitation. <em>Hahaha.</em> I threw in a final <em>“Well done, lads—can’t wait
                    to read them!”</em> just to show how gracious I was.
                    <br><br>
                    Then Molly, our design editor, piped up. <em>“I don’t even know what CL is.”</em> Instead of simply
                    explaining it, I dropped a Ricky Gervais meme (as shown below). The lads responded with laughing
                    emojis. The women in the chat? A <em>deluge</em> of outrage. I’m <em>bad</em> laughing…
                    <br><br>
                    Any who, that’s enough interlocution for this evening.

                <h2>Part Six - A Day in the Life</h2>
                <h5>Monday, 3rd February <strong>22:19 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Woke up at 10:40 this morning—just to set a precedent. Two texts from Silvio instructing me to meet
                    him at the church. Within this small cluster of houses, there’s a church, a few storage buildings,
                    and other assorted structures that seem to serve no clear purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    Monday’s tasks were as uninspiring as expected—hauling wood outside the bungalow, sweeping up,
                    tidying the walkways. Menial but necessary. Silvio’s little house, a product of his own hands (and a
                    few Workaway volunteers over the years), stands as a testament to determination—if not necessarily
                    to craftsmanship. For that reason, I can excuse the loose wiring and the temperamental water flow.
                    Consider them <em>charming quirks</em> rather than flaws.
                    <br><br>
                    With the jobs done by half one, I headed into Palermo. It felt like Stockholm again—Kindle in hand,
                    zoning out on the metro, heading straight for the centre. The closer we got, the more the scenery
                    improved. Gone were the rundown streets and battered cars. Instead, grand old buildings, buzzing
                    cafés, and streets that actually looked like they belonged in Italy. <em>This</em> was the Palermo I
                    had imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked from the station to the docks, covering the harbour and following the shoreline. No real
                    plan—just wandering. The sea breeze, the smell of salt and espresso mixing in the air, the city
                    shifting from chaotic to calm the further I went. The place has layers. Tourists snapping pics
                    outside cathedrals, locals arguing on street corners, old men in sharp suits sipping espresso like
                    they own the place. Maybe they do.
                    <br><br>
                    I kept walking until the sun dipped and the streetlights flickered on. That was my cue to turn back,
                    retracing my steps to the station, ready to catch the train home. A solid first look at Palermo.
                    Tomorrow, I go deeper.
                    <br><br>
                    25,000 steps and seven miles later, I’m back at Silvio’s with a feast of sausages, roast potatoes
                    and onions waiting for me. Thank goodness it wasn’t more dough. I needed to discreetly bin the
                    leftover pizza that he made me for lunch because the dough’s texture was similar to glue.
                    <br><br>
                    Over dinner, Silvio went further into his philosophy of parenting, love of food, staying connected
                    with our roots. Then he moved onto some contentious issues: Palestine-Gaza, Trump, thoughts on
                    homosexuality. Some opinions differed to my own, though I wasn’t going to disagree. <em>Don’t bite
                    the hand that feeds you.</em>

                <h2>Part Five - First Impressions</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>21:45 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Everything I eat this week is going to be some combination of dough and mozzarella. My cholesterol
                    is about to skyrocket. The two meals I’ve had today were pleasant enough, but overwhelmingly
                    dough-based, and I’m already craving some variety. Slim chance. My portion sizes are already
                    small—famously so—but I don’t want to seem impertinent by leaving food unfinished. Hence why I’m
                    sitting here writing, trying to distract myself from the nausea, instead of catching up on
                    much-needed sleep. I was up at 4 a.m. to catch the bus from Mile End—it’s a miracle I’m still awake.
                    <br><br>
                    First impressions? Mixed. The house was entirely built by Silvio and a rotating cast of Workaway
                    volunteers, so if a joist collapses in the middle of the night, I won’t be surprised. The area
                    leaves much to be desired, but for just €2 a day, I’ll be escaping to Palermo whenever I can.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio is amicable and always up for conversation. The reason he hosts volunteers, he says, is
                    because his ex-wife has instilled a fear of strangers in their children—taught them to stay away,
                    not to explore, not to trust. Silvio is determined to prove her wrong by inviting strangers into his
                    home. An interesting strategy for winning an argument, especially with someone he openly despises,
                    but hey-ho.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing I’ve quickly picked up on in Tommaso Natale—there’s no middle ground when it comes to
                    cars. You’re either driving a battered Toyota or Citroën, held together by sheer willpower, or
                    you’re gliding around in a pristine, brand-new Alfa Romeo or Mercedes. No in-between. The disparity
                    was even more glaring this afternoon at Montello Beach. There are just some cars that no one dared
                    to touch.

                <h2>Part Four - Roaming the Area</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>17:49 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I set off with my camera to explore the neighbourhood, only to find more of the same desolation I
                    had witnessed on the drive in. Litter blanketed the streets, shattered glass crunched underfoot, and
                    every other window seemed to have surrendered to vandalism. The roads were a free-for-all—cars
                    careening past at reckless speeds, emboldened by the absence of cameras or speed bumps. If I were
                    documenting the decay of civilisation, this would be an excellent place to start. Thankfully, with
                    the train so close, I’ll be escaping to Palermo most days to distance myself from this slum.
                    <br><br>
                    As I meandered through the streets, camera in hand, I encountered four people over the course of
                    half an hour, each of whom responded with irritated gestures and muttered variations of <em>“No
                    fotodora, no fotodora.”</em> I don’t speak Italian, but the message was clear. It wasn’t exactly
                    the warm reception I had envisioned. An hour into my walk, it became apparent that this town was
                    little more than a pit stop—a transit hub on the way to somewhere better. There was no lingering
                    charm, no picturesque beauty to unearth. The coast lies 5km east, and Palermo is just a short train
                    ride away. At least the train is cheap. Even cheaper if I feign ignorance and ride the wave of
                    tourist oblivion.
                    <br><br>
                    Once Silvio’s friends had dispersed, we headed to Montello Beach. A quaint seaside town, it ticks
                    the expected boxes—an improvement on the suburbs, but still falling short of the Sicilian paradise I
                    had imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    According to Silvio, the town’s social divide is glaringly obvious. <em>“There are two groups,”</em>
                    he told me. <em>“Italians and Albanians.”</em> I asked how I was supposed to tell the difference. He
                    smirked. <em>“You’ll know.”</em> I thought he was joking—until I saw it for myself.
                    <br><br>
                    The contrast is stark. The Italians are effortlessly well-groomed, with chiselled jawlines and skin
                    so clear it could be bottled and sold. The Albanians, in contrast, are built like barrels—just as
                    wide as they are tall—uniformly clad in full Slazenger tracksuits. They control the games, the
                    street vendors, the lucky lucky men who peddle trinkets along the beach. Before we split up, Silvio
                    offered one final piece of advice: <em>“Keep a tight grip on your camera.”</em>

                <h2>Part Three - Meeting Silvio</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>12:15 CET</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    The four-hour flight turned out to be just two and a half—a sign of good fortune, surely. I caught
                    the train just as it was departing, and whether it was my tourist status or the fact that I flashed
                    the inspector a screenshot of a valid ticket, I somehow got the journey for free.
                    <br><br>
                    I was meeting Silvio at Tommaso Natale Station, 15 minutes outside Palermo. A small town that,
                    unfortunately, does not live up to the romanticised images of Sicilian charm. No sidewalks,
                    litter-strewn roadsides, battered cars that look like they’ve barely survived their last outing—what
                    kind of slum have I landed in?
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio pulled up in a black Toyota Yaris, as dilapidated as its surroundings. The front bumper
                    dangled precariously, while streaks of red paint hinted at a few too many close encounters. I loaded
                    my case, and just like that, we were off—at a speed that suggested he mistook my arrival for the
                    start of a Formula One sprint. The first thing he said was, "<em>My English is not perfect.</em>"
                    Setting expectations early—exactly what I would do.
                    <br><br>
                    His house is only a short drive from the station. I could have walked, but he insisted on playing
                    the gracious host. A better first impression than Caroline in Güéjar Sierra—after a three-hour bus
                    from Málaga and two more from Granada, she couldn’t even be bothered to pick me up from the foot of
                    the mountain in the sweltering heat.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio offered two warnings before I ventured out exploring:
                    <br><br>
                    1. <em>Watch out for cars when stepping out the front door. The house sits directly on a main road,
                    and buses, in particular, skim dangerously close since there’s no sidewalk.</em>
                    <br>2.<em> Watch out for the mafia.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    Excuse me?
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t question him. Maybe I misheard. Maybe his English wasn’t quite translating the way he
                    intended. Either way, I filed that little nugget of information away for later.
                    <br><br>
                    When we arrived, Silvio was already hosting friends—apparently a frequent occurrence, given that his
                    kitchen is equipped like a professional setup. Whether this is because he’s a chef or simply a
                    product of his Italian heritage remains to be seen.
                    <br><br>
                    His house is a small cottage within a gated community, tucked away at the end of a courtyard where
                    chickens and hens roam freely. My room is cozy, nestled at the back of the house, complete with a
                    double bed and squeaky closets. A quick inspection revealed the <em>Complete Works of
                    Shakespeare</em>—in Italian. That’s a conversation I’m looking forward to.
                    <br><br>
                    Silvio gave me a tour of the house and the property, but we haven’t yet discussed what exactly I’ll
                    be doing here. Judging by my surroundings, I suspect the work will be simple yet
                    time-consuming—collecting eggs, washing dishes, helping with meals. Speaking of meals, Silvio
                    mentioned he’ll be giving me a menu before each one. I’m probably about to eat the best food of my
                    life, but will I appreciate it with my tragically undeveloped palate? Bolognese, pasta, pizza,
                    lasagna—he assures me he can make them the <em>new way</em> or the <em>classic way</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    But the real question is—can he make it just like <em>mother makes…?</em>

                <h2>Part Two - The Journey's always the best part</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>08:13 GMT</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    That’s a lie. The journey is never the best part when traveling alone. The real magic begins when
                    you’re finally set loose in a new city, armed only with your wits and the burning need to experience
                    everything and everyone in the fleeting time you have.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I’m headed to Palermo—but Palermo is a broad term, the same way London is. I could claim to
                    live in London while renting a flat in Watford. My point? I highly doubt Silvio’s place is nestled
                    in the heart of Sicily’s tourist hub. More likely, he’s tucked away in some suburban sprawl. I’m
                    just hoping he’s not too far from the action—and that the public transport system is at least
                    somewhat intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    So, what are my goals for this week? Learn a little Italian. Explore a new city. Take an obscene
                    amount of photos. And—most importantly—commit to a digital detox. It’s something I’ve been meaning
                    to do for ages, but it’s hardly practical while juggling a Computer Science degree. This week,
                    though, I’m officially off the grid (minus these blog updates, of course). No deadlines to meet, no
                    articles to write, no software to debug. Just pure, uninterrupted freedom.
                    <br><br>
                    So far, everything is running smoothly. And if the woman behind me would kindly stop kneeing my
                    chair, this day might just shape up to be a beautiful one.

                <h2>Part One - Here we go again</h2>
                <h5>Sunday, 2nd February <strong>05:23 GMT</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    Airports: the only socially acceptable place to start drinking at 6 a.m. With just a few minutes
                    until boarding, I figured I’d kick off my Workaway 2.0 journal by answering all your burning
                    questions.
                    <br><br>
                    This time, I’m headed to Palermo, Sicily, for my second Workaway experience. After my first
                    excursion failed to be an overwhelming success, I’m determined to give it another go—this time with
                    more realistic expectations. This trip is the epitome of spontaneity. I only started searching for
                    hosts a week ago, so when I say last minute, I mean <em>last minute</em>. Out of the twelve hosts
                    who
                    responded, only two had availability: Silvio in Sicily and Benoît in Mons. Sicily seemed like the
                    better fit.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, Silvio’s profile was rather vague about the tasks he needed help with, and given the hasty
                    nature of this trip, we haven’t even had a FaceTime call to go over the details. Our correspondence
                    has been daily, though, and his profile boasts a dozen glowing reviews. What could possibly go
                    wrong?
                    <br><br>
                    Apparently, I won’t be the only one staying at his place during my ten-day visit, but as for who
                    this mystery guest is? No idea. I’m fully aware I’m walking into a potentially precarious
                    situation—but at the very least, I’ll have a story to tell... the police.
